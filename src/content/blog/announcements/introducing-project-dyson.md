# Introducing Project Dyson

Project Dyson is a non-profit organization dedicated to the ambitious goal of making a Dyson swarm a reality. While this may seem like science fiction today, we believe that with proper planning, research aggregation, and collaborative effort, humanity can achieve this monumental feat.

## What is a Dyson Swarm?

A Dyson swarm is a hypothetical megastructure consisting of a large number of independent constructs (usually solar power satellites and space habitats) orbiting a star. Unlike a solid Dyson sphere, a swarm is composed of many smaller elements that can be built incrementally.

## Our Approach

We're taking a phased approach to this challenge:

1. **Research Aggregation**: Collecting and organizing relevant scientific papers
2. **Multi-LLM Collaboration**: Using multiple AI models to analyze challenges
3. **Open Planning**: Transparent, community-driven development of construction phases
4. **Bill of Materials**: Detailed cost and resource estimates for each phase

## Get Involved

We welcome researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts to join our mission. Visit our plan section to see our current roadmap and contribute to the discussion.
