# Building Partnerships: External Organizations Registry

Project Dyson isn't building a Dyson swarm alone. The specifications, cost estimates, and technical approaches documented here draw on decades of research from space agencies, universities, and industry partners worldwide.

Today we're launching the **External Organizations Registry**—a structured way to track which organizations inform our work and what questions we need to ask them.

## Why Track Organizations?

Every technical claim in Project Dyson traces back to real-world expertise:
- **NASA** operates the Deep Space Network we'd rely on for communication
- **JAXA** returned asteroid samples that inform our ISRU assumptions
- **JPL** develops the propulsion systems we specify
- **ESA** researches solar sail technologies for station-keeping

By formally tracking these relationships, we can:
1. **Acknowledge sources** of critical data
2. **Identify gaps** where we need expert input
3. **Plan outreach** to validate assumptions
4. **Build credibility** through documented expertise

## Organization Categories

The registry organizes partners by domain:

| Category | Examples | Relevance |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Space Agency** | NASA, ESA, JAXA, CNSA | Mission heritage, infrastructure |
| **Propulsion Lab** | JPL, ERPS, Ad Astra | Thruster specifications |
| **PV Research** | Fraunhofer ISE, NREL | Solar cell efficiency data |
| **Manufacturing** | SpaceX, Relativity | Production cost baselines |
| **University** | MIT, Caltech, TU Delft | Research papers, analysis |
| **Standards Body** | CCSDS, AIAA | Protocol specifications |

## Organization Questions

Each organization entry includes **specific questions** we need answered:

### Example: NASA (Jet Propulsion Laboratory)

| Question | Status | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------|
| What is current Hall-effect thruster TRL for 50+ kW? | Draft | High |
| Can DSN support 10,000+ spacecraft swarm communication? | Awaiting Response | Critical |
| What thermal limits apply at 0.5 AU operations? | Responded | Medium |

Questions link to the research questions they help resolve, creating traceability from expert input to specification updates.

## Current Registry

The initial registry includes 15 organizations across all categories:

### Space Agencies
- **NASA** — Mission heritage, DSN, propulsion research
- **ESA** — Solar sail development, asteroid missions
- **JAXA** — Hayabusa samples, ISRU data

### Propulsion Labs
- **JPL** — Ion propulsion, autonomous systems
- **Ad Astra Rocket Company** — VASIMR development

### PV Research
- **Fraunhofer ISE** — Solar cell efficiency records
- **NREL** — Space-qualified photovoltaics

### Manufacturing
- **SpaceX** — Launch costs, Starlink production rates
- **Relativity Space** — 3D printing for space

### Universities
- **MIT** — Swarm coordination, autonomy research
- **Caltech** — MAPLE power transmission demonstration

## Outreach Tracking

The registry tracks engagement status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Draft** | Question formulated but not sent |
| **Sent** | Outreach initiated |
| **Awaiting Response** | No response yet |
| **Responded** | Answer received |
| **Closed** | Question resolved or no longer relevant |

This visibility helps prioritize follow-up and identifies which organizations are responsive.

## How Organizations Inform Specifications

Each organization page shows:
- **Relevant domains** — What aspects of the project they inform
- **BOM connections** — Which items use their data
- **Research questions** — Which RQs they help answer
- **Contact status** — Current engagement level

### Example: Fraunhofer ISE → Solar Collector Units

Fraunhofer ISE's record-breaking 47.6% multi-junction cell efficiency directly informs our Solar Collector Unit specifications. Their research on radiation degradation rates affects our 10-year operational lifetime assumptions.

## Try It Yourself

Explore the registry:
- [All Organizations](/organizations) — Browse by category
- Individual organization pages — See questions and connections
- [Research Questions](/questions) — See which RQs link to organizations

## What's Next

We're working on:
1. **Formal outreach program** — Template letters for expert engagement
2. **Response tracking** — Document expert feedback systematically
3. **Citation system** — Link specifications to authoritative sources
4. **Partnership opportunities** — Identify collaboration possibilities

The organizations registry makes Project Dyson's knowledge sources explicit. Every specification has a pedigree, every assumption has an expert behind it, and every gap has an outreach plan.
