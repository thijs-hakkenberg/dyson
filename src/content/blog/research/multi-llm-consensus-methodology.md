# How We Use AI for Engineering Decisions

Project Dyson employs a unique approach to engineering analysis: querying multiple large language models and having them cross-review each other's analyses to build consensus on complex challenges.

## Multi-LLM Consensus

Our analysis process involves three frontier AI models:

- **Gemini 3 Pro**: Google's advanced reasoning model
- **GPT-5.2**: OpenAI's latest generation
- **Claude Opus 4.5**: Anthropic's most capable model

## Why Multiple Models?

Each AI model has different:

- Training data and knowledge bases
- Reasoning approaches
- Potential blind spots

By consulting multiple models and having them review each other's work, we can:

1. Identify consensus on well-established facts
2. Highlight areas of uncertainty
3. Discover novel approaches we might have missed
4. Cross-validate cost estimates and timelines

## Our Process

1. **Initial Analysis**: Each model independently produces a detailed phase plan
2. **Cross-Review**: Each model reviews the other models' plans
3. **Consensus Building**: We synthesize areas of agreement
4. **Gap Analysis**: We highlight significant disagreements for human review

## Limitations

It's important to note that AI analysis supplements, but doesn't replace, expert human judgment. All LLM opinions are reviewed by domain experts before being incorporated into our plans.
