# What AI Gets Right (and Wrong) About Space Mining

After extensive cross-review sessions between our three AI models, we've identified patterns in what they excel at and where human expertise remains essential.

## What AI Does Well

### Literature Synthesis
All models demonstrated excellent ability to synthesize information from scientific literature, citing relevant missions and studies.

### Cost Modeling
Models produced detailed, justified cost estimates with clear assumptions—though they often disagreed on values.

### Risk Identification
Each model identified legitimate technical risks, often catching different subsets of potential issues.

### System-Level Thinking
The models excelled at understanding dependencies between subsystems and phases.

## Common Blind Spots

### Regulatory and Political Factors
All models underweighted:
- International space law complexities
- Export control restrictions
- Planetary protection requirements

### Human Factors
Limited attention to:
- Crew safety (for partially crewed missions)
- Ground team fatigue during extended operations
- Public communication and engagement

### Integration Complexity
Tended to underestimate:
- Interface challenges between systems
- Testing logistics
- Supply chain dependencies

## How We Address This

1. **Human review** of all AI-generated content
2. **Expert consultation** for regulatory and policy aspects
3. **Cross-model review** to catch individual blind spots
4. **Explicit uncertainty tracking** for contested estimates

## Conclusion

AI analysis is a powerful tool for megastructure planning, but it works best as an input to human decision-making rather than a replacement for it.
