# Comparing AI Approaches to Dyson Swarm Planning

We've gathered detailed Phase 0 and Phase 1 plans from three frontier AI models. Here's what we learned from their different approaches.

## Methodology

Each model was given the same prompt requesting:
- Executive summary
- Detailed Bill of Materials
- Cost breakdown with confidence intervals
- Timeline and dependencies
- Technical challenges
- Research requirements

## Key Differences

### Cost Estimation Approaches

**Gemini 3 Pro** tends to provide conservative estimates with explicit uncertainty ranges, often citing historical space mission costs as baselines.

**GPT-5.2** offers detailed cost justifications tied to current commercial space pricing, with assumptions clearly stated.

**Claude Opus 4.5** balances optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, providing sensitivity analysis on key cost drivers.

### Technical Focus Areas

Different models emphasized different aspects:
- Gemini focused heavily on autonomous systems and fault tolerance
- GPT-5.2 emphasized material processing and thermal management
- Claude prioritized anchoring systems and dust mitigation

### Timeline Variations

All models agreed on the 6-7 year timeframe for Phase 0, but differed on:
- Critical path identification
- Parallelization opportunities
- Risk buffer allocations

## Consensus Areas

Despite their differences, the models agreed on several key points:
1. Starting with a small, well-characterized NEA target
2. Prioritizing oxygen extraction as the primary product
3. The importance of dust mitigation systems
4. Need for extensive ground testing before deployment

## Next Steps

We're now synthesizing these perspectives into unified consensus documents for each phase.
