# Phase 0: Space Resource Processing

Before we can build millions of solar collector satellites, we need raw materials. Earth-based resources are expensive to launch into orbit, making space-based resource extraction essential for any megastructure project.

## Why Start with Mining?

The economics are simple: launching materials from Earth costs approximately $2,500-10,000 per kilogram. At these prices, a single solar collector satellite would be economically unfeasible. Asteroid mining changes this equation entirely.

## Target Asteroids

We've identified several categories of near-Earth asteroids suitable for initial mining operations:

- **C-type asteroids**: Rich in water and organic compounds
- **M-type asteroids**: Metallic composition, ideal for structural materials
- **S-type asteroids**: Silicate-rich, useful for various applications

## Key Technologies

Phase 0 requires development in several areas:

- Autonomous mining robots
- In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems
- Orbital processing facilities
- Material transport systems

See our detailed Bill of Materials for cost estimates.
