# Phase 0 BOM: Three AI Perspectives

Our multi-LLM consensus approach has yielded fascinating insights into how different AI models approach the Bill of Materials for space resource processing.

## Total Cost Estimates

| Model | Point Estimate | Confidence Range |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| Gemini 3 Pro | $7.2B | ±35% |
| GPT-5.2 | $6.1B | ±30% |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | $13.75B | ±25% |

## Why Such Variation?

The cost differences stem from different assumptions about:

### Scope Definition
- What constitutes "Phase 0 complete"?
- How much redundancy is needed?
- What level of autonomy is required?

### Technology Readiness
- Models made different assumptions about TRL advancement by project start
- Varying estimates for FOAK (First-of-a-Kind) development costs

### Risk Allocation
- Different approaches to contingency budgeting
- Varying insurance and reserve requirements

## Areas of Agreement

All three models agreed that major cost drivers include:
1. **High-power solar arrays** (250-400 kW class)
2. **SEP tug development** with autonomous operations
3. **Processing platform development** (FOAK industrial spacecraft)
4. **Dust mitigation systems** (critical path item)

## Synthesis

Our consensus estimate targets the middle range (~$9B) with explicit carve-outs for:
- Technology demonstration missions
- Risk reduction activities
- Schedule margin
