# Solar Sail Technology Review

Solar sails represent a key technology for maintaining Dyson swarm satellite positions without propellant consumption. This article reviews the current state of the art and future developments needed for megastructure applications.

## How Solar Sails Work

Solar sails generate thrust from radiation pressure—photons from the Sun bouncing off a reflective surface transfer momentum to the sail. While the force is small, it's continuous and requires no fuel.

## Current Demonstrations

Recent missions have validated solar sail technology:

- JAXA's IKAROS (2010): First successful interplanetary solar sail
- Planetary Society's LightSail 2 (2019): Demonstrated controlled solar sailing
- NASA's NEA Scout (2022): CubeSat solar sail mission

## Requirements for Dyson Swarm

Swarm satellites will need solar sails for:

- Initial positioning after deployment
- Continuous station-keeping against perturbations
- Collision avoidance maneuvers
- End-of-life deorbiting

## Research Gaps

Key areas requiring further development:

- Ultra-lightweight sail materials
- Autonomous navigation systems
- Long-duration material degradation studies
- Scalable manufacturing processes
