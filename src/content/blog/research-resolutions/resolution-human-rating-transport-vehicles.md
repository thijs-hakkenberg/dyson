# Resolved: The $200M Question on Human-Rating Transport Vehicles

After structured deliberation between Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Pro, and GPT-5.2, we've reached consensus on one of Phase 0's most consequential design decisions: **should the 10 Transport Vehicles be designed for human crew from the start?**

The answer: **yes, but with a clever twist**.

## The Core Tension

The original consensus document identified a 40-60% cost increase for permanent human-rating of all vehicles versus cargo-only design. But it also flagged a 2-3x retrofit penalty if we defer human-rating and later find crew transport necessary.

This sets up a classic engineering gamble: pay now or pay (much) more later?

## The Modular Solution

The discussion converged on a **modular human-rating architecture**:

1. **All 10 vehicles get permanent structural provisions** for human-rating from day one
2. **Crew modules, life support, and radiation shielding** are implemented as installable kits
3. **Only 3 crew module kits** are procured for the 10-vehicle fleet

### Cost Impact

| Approach | Program Cost | vs. Baseline |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Cargo-only baseline | $2.0B | — |
| Modular human-rating | $2.24-2.40B | +12-20% |
| Full permanent human-rating | $2.8-3.2B | +40-60% |
| Defer then retrofit | $4.0-6.0B | +100-200% |

The modular approach costs only 12-20% more than cargo-only, versus 40-60% for full permanent human-rating or 2-3x for retrofit.

## Why This Works

### Mass Penalty is Negligible

The permanent structural provisions (3g emergency acceleration rating, redundant avionics, crew module interfaces) add only 2,000-4,000 kg per vehicle. For a 200,000 kg payload baseline, that's **1-2%**—a trivially justified insurance premium.

### Fleet Flexibility

With 3 interchangeable crew module kits:
- Up to 3 vehicles can operate crewed missions simultaneously
- 7 vehicles remain in pure cargo configuration
- Kits can be swapped between vehicles at the Processing Station
- Inherent rescue capability through fleet mutual aid

### Crew Demand is Coming

The discussion established high confidence that crew transport will become essential by Years 4-5 as Processing Station operational complexity exceeds the limits of autonomous systems and teleoperation under light-time delay.

## The Abort Philosophy Shift

A critical design philosophy emerged: **traditional Earth-return abort is neither feasible nor necessary**.

For deep-space operations, the discussion converged on a tiered approach:
1. **Shelter-in-place** (30+ day self-sufficiency)
2. **Divert-to-nearest-facility**
3. **Fleet-based crew rescue**

This dramatically reduces abort propellant reserves compared to Earth-return capability, which would require impossible delta-V budgets at asteroid belt distances.

## Certification Strategy

The recommendation: develop a **project-specific human-rating standard** rather than pursuing NASA NPR 8705.2 certification. Earth-centric frameworks would impose inappropriate constraints and multi-year schedule penalties on deep-space vehicle design.

The project-specific standard derives safety requirements from NPR 8705.2 principles but tailors them for deep-space operations with an independent review board.

## Immediate Actions

1. **Incorporate structural human-rating provisions** into vehicle preliminary design before System Requirements Review
2. **Commission radiation environment trade study** to resolve shielding mass uncertainty (4,000-8,000 kg estimate is largest unknown)
3. **Develop crew transport demand model** to validate Year 4-5 timeline
4. **Establish Human-Rating Standards Working Group** to develop project-specific certification approach
5. **Design crew module interface** and validate through physical prototype testing

## Key Insight

The winning argument reframed the question from "should we human-rate?" to "what's our exposure if we can't retrofit later?"

Structural provisions that cost 1-2% of payload capacity today could prevent a 2-3x cost multiplier in Year 5 when crew transport becomes essential. That's not a design decision—it's risk management.
