papers:
  - arxiv_id: "1301.1278"
    title: "III-V Solar Cells"
    authors: ["James P. Connolly", "Denis Mencaraglia"]
    relevance: critical
    summary: "Comprehensive review of III-V materials for high-efficiency solar cells covering growth methods, material properties, and heterogeneous material integration. Analyzes energy loss mechanisms across single, tandem, and triple junction designs. Key finding that nanostructured cells operate in a radiatively dominated mode closer to theoretical limits. Provides the foundational materials science context for evaluating both flat-plate and concentrator architectures."

    title: "Effects of irradiation on Triple and Single Junction InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar cells"
    authors: ["Roberta Campesato", "Carsten Baur", "Mariacristina Casale", "Massimo Gervasi"]
    relevance: critical
    summary: "Directly characterizes radiation damage to the exact cell type specified for Project Dyson (InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple junction). Uses Displacement Damage Dose methodology to establish single degradation curves for each electrical parameter. Essential for predicting end-of-life performance in the L4/L5 radiation environment for both flat-plate and concentrator configurations."

    title: "Radiation hardness and post irradiation regeneration behavior of GaInAsP solar cells"
    authors: ["R. Lang", "J. Schön", "J. Lefèvre", "B. Boizot", "F. Dimroth", "D. Lackner"]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Demonstrates post-irradiation regeneration in GaInAsP cells under satellite operating conditions (60C, AM0 illumination). Recovery strengthens with increasing InP fraction. Relevant to concentrator vs. flat-plate decision because concentrator cells operate at higher temperatures, potentially enhancing radiation damage annealing—a previously unrecognized advantage of concentrated operation."

    title: "On the Use of Graphene to Improve the Performance of Concentrator III-V Multijunction Solar Cells"
    authors: ["Laura Barrutia", "Iván Lombardero", "Mario Ochoa", "Carlos Algora"]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Demonstrates graphene integration in concentrator III-V cells reducing series resistance by 35% and improving fill factor by 4% with nearly 1% absolute efficiency gain at 1,000 suns. Directly applicable to the concentrator architecture option, showing that advanced materials can mitigate the series resistance losses that become dominant at high concentration ratios."

    title: "Novel high efficiency quadruple junction solar cell with current matching and quantum efficiency simulations"
    authors: ["Mohammad Jobayer Hossain", "Bibek Tiwari", "Indranil Bhattacharya"]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Simulates a four-junction cell achieving 47.2% theoretical efficiency under 1-sun, absorbing from UV to deep IR. While the specific cell architecture is next-generation, the current-matching methodology and quantum efficiency simulation approach apply directly to evaluating how concentrator vs. flat-plate operation affects subcell balance in the triple-junction baseline design."

    title: "Broadband and omnidirectional anti-reflection layer for III/V multi-junction solar cells"
    authors: ["Silke L. Diedenhofen", "Grzegorz Grzela", "Erik Haverkamp", "Gerard Bauhuis", "John Schermer", "Jaime Gómez Rivas"]
    relevance: medium
    summary: "Develops graded refractive index antireflection coating using tapered GaP nanowires achieving 5.9% photocurrent density increase on quadruple junction cells. Relevant to flat-plate optimization: advanced AR coatings can reduce the efficiency gap between flat-plate and concentrator operation by capturing more off-axis light, reducing the incentive for concentration."

    title: "Moon's Radiation Environment and Expected Performance of Solar Cells during Future Lunar Missions"
    authors: ["T. E. Girish", "S. Aranya"]
    relevance: medium
    summary: "Models solar cell performance degradation in the lunar radiation environment. While focused on the Moon rather than L4/L5, the radiation damage modeling methodology and cell degradation predictions provide a transferable framework. The L4/L5 environment shares the same solar particle flux and galactic cosmic ray background."

  - "Triple-junction InGaP/GaAs/Ge radiation degradation follows single-parameter Displacement Damage Dose curves, enabling predictable end-of-life performance estimation"
  - "Post-irradiation regeneration occurs at elevated temperatures—concentrator cells running hotter may partially self-anneal radiation damage"
  - "Graphene integration reduces concentrator cell series resistance by 35%, partially addressing the high-current challenge at concentration"
  - "Advanced AR coatings can improve flat-plate performance by 5.9%, narrowing the efficiency gap with concentrators"
  - "Four-junction cells approaching 47% theoretical efficiency may shift the cost-benefit analysis toward flat-plate designs as cell efficiency itself reduces area requirements"
  - "Nanostructured III-V cells operate closer to radiative limits, potentially enabling high efficiency at lower concentration ratios"
