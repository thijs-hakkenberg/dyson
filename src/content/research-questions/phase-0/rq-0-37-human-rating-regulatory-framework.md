## Background

The rq-0-18 resolution established that transport vehicles should incorporate human-rating provisions, but left open the question of which certification standard applies. Existing frameworks — NASA NPR 8705.2 for government missions, FAA commercial crew requirements, and various international standards — were designed for Earth-orbital or lunar operations. Deep-space operations at L4/L5 with multi-week transit times on ion propulsion present scenarios (no Earth-return abort, extended radiation exposure, months-long mission durations) that fall outside the assumptions of existing standards.

## Why This Matters

The regulatory framework determines:
- Design requirements (redundancy levels, abort capability, life support margins)
- Certification cost and timeline (2-4 years for existing standards)
- Liability exposure for crew operations
- Insurance requirements and availability
- Whether Project Dyson must create a novel certification framework

Attempting to meet NASA commercial crew standards designed for LEO operations could impose unnecessary mass and complexity penalties. Conversely, an insufficiently rigorous project-specific standard could expose the program to liability and reputational risk.

## Key Considerations

- No existing human-rating standard addresses deep-space industrial operations
- Abort-to-safe-haven is fundamentally different from abort-to-Earth
- Long transit times require different life support reliability standards than short missions
- The Outer Space Treaty places liability on launching states, not private operators
- Commercial spaceflight frameworks are evolving rapidly (2024-2026 regulatory updates)
- International coordination may be required given Project Dyson's multinational scope

## Research Directions

1. **Gap analysis of existing standards**: Map NASA NPR 8705.2 and FAA requirements against Project Dyson mission profiles, identifying requirements that are inapplicable, insufficient, or missing.

2. **Shelter-in-place protocol development**: Define abort alternatives appropriate for deep-space operations where Earth return is not feasible, establishing equivalent safety levels.

3. **Liability framework assessment**: Evaluate Outer Space Treaty, national space legislation, and commercial frameworks to determine the legal structure for crew operations at L4/L5.

4. **Industry precedent survey**: Review SpaceX Starship, Blue Origin, and other commercial deep-space vehicle certification approaches for applicable practices.

5. **Project-specific standard proposal**: Draft a human-rating standard tailored to deep-space industrial operations, referencing existing standards where applicable and proposing novel requirements where gaps exist.
