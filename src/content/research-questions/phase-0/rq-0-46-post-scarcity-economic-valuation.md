## Background

The rq-0-28 resolution identified a fundamental problem: traditional cost accounting (ROI, NPV, LCOE) may not apply to a self-replicating system using free sunlight and free asteroid materials. When the marginal cost of production approaches zero, conventional economic frameworks fail to capture value creation. Project Dyson needs appropriate valuation frameworks to communicate project worth to stakeholders, justify investment decisions, and plan resource allocation — but the existing frameworks were designed for scarcity-based economies.

## Why This Matters

Without appropriate economic frameworks:
- Investors cannot evaluate project returns using familiar metrics
- Budget comparisons against terrestrial projects are misleading
- Resource allocation between phases lacks a rational basis
- The project's transformative potential is either understated or overstated
- Governance structures (rq-0-29) lack economic foundations for decision-making

The transition from scarcity-based (Phase 0-1) to post-scarcity (Phase 2-3) economics happens during the project lifecycle, requiring frameworks that work across both regimes.

## Key Considerations

- Traditional NPV discounts future value, which may be inappropriate for exponentially growing systems
- Energy-based valuation (joules produced over lifetime) provides a physics-grounded metric
- Capability-based valuation (what the system can do) may be more meaningful than cost-based
- Comparison with terrestrial infrastructure (power grid, internet) may provide analogs
- Different stakeholders need different valuation perspectives (scientific, economic, existential risk)
- Ethical dimensions of post-scarcity resource access must inform valuation

## Research Directions

1. **Energy return on investment (EROI)**: Calculate lifetime energy output vs. energy invested for the complete Dyson swarm, providing a physics-based value metric independent of monetary systems.

2. **Capability growth curves**: Model the growth of manufacturing capability, power generation, and computational capacity over time as alternative value metrics.

3. **Transition economics framework**: Develop a hybrid framework that uses traditional economics for Phases 0-1 and transitions to alternative metrics for Phases 2-3 at the self-sufficiency threshold.

4. **Terrestrial analog analysis**: Study how transformative infrastructure projects (railroads, internet, power grids) were valued during their exponential growth phases for applicable precedents.

5. **Stakeholder-specific value propositions**: Develop tailored economic narratives for different audiences (scientific community, investors, governments, general public) using appropriate metrics for each.
