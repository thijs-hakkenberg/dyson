    title: "Cooling power analysis of small scale 4K pulse tube cryocooler"
    authors: ["T. Schmidt", "et al."]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Analyzes cooling capacity and performance characteristics of small-scale pulse tube cryocoolers operating at 4K. Demonstrates methods for characterizing cooling power as a function of operating parameters including frequency, pressure ratio, and regenerator geometry. The analytical framework for cooling capacity evaluation is directly applicable to assessing pulse tube scaling potential for the 20K ZBO application, where understanding how cooling power scales with physical dimensions and operating conditions is essential for projecting from current milliwatt-class units to the hundred-watt regime."

    title: "Development of dry linear compressor for GM and pulse tube cryocoolers"
    authors: ["J. Höhne"]
    relevance: medium
    summary: "Describes development of oil-free linear compressor technology for Gifford-McMahon and pulse tube cryocoolers. Dry compressors eliminate contamination risk and improve long-term reliability—both critical requirements for space applications. The compressor is typically the life-limiting component in reciprocating cryocoolers, so advances in dry linear compressor technology directly impact the feasibility of long-duration (30-year) space cryocooler operation. Relevant to understanding the compressor technology development pathway that feeds into flight cryocooler scaling."

    title: "Cold-tip temperature control of space-borne Stirling cryocooler"
    authors: ["S. Nagarsheth", "et al."]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Addresses control system design and thermal modeling for space-borne Stirling cryocoolers, focusing on cold-tip temperature regulation under varying heat loads and environmental conditions. Demonstrates control strategies for maintaining stable cryogenic temperatures in the presence of orbital thermal transients. Directly relevant to the station's cryocooler control architecture—maintaining 20K within tight tolerances while managing variable heat loads from solar orientation changes, propellant transfer operations, and cryocooler duty cycling. The modeling approach extends to larger-scale systems."

    title: "Cryocooler conduction cooled SRF cavity at practical gradients"
    authors: ["R. Dhuley", "et al."]
    relevance: medium
    summary: "Demonstrates practical conduction cooling of superconducting radio-frequency cavities using commercial cryocoolers, achieving useful accelerating gradients without liquid helium. Shows that cryocooler conduction cooling can replace traditional bath cooling for specific applications. While the SRF application differs from propellant storage, the conduction cooling architecture—thermal bus connecting cryocooler cold head to distributed thermal loads—parallels the distributed cooling approach needed for large cryogenic tanks where the cryocooler cannot be co-located with the entire thermal load."

    title: "Modeling cooldown of cryocooler conduction-cooled devices"
    authors: ["R. Dhuley"]
    relevance: medium
    summary: "Develops thermal modeling framework for predicting cooldown transients in cryocooler conduction-cooled systems. Models the time-dependent behavior including thermal resistance of conduction paths, cryocooler load curves, and parasitic heat loads. The modeling methodology applies directly to predicting cooldown times for station cryogenic tanks after initial fill or thermal excursions. For a 50-100 tonne LH2 depot, cooldown time from ambient to 20K is a critical operational parameter affecting station commissioning and recovery from off-nominal thermal events."

    title: "Active noise cancellation for CUORE pulse tube cryocoolers"
    authors: ["A. D'Addabbo", "et al."]
    relevance: low
    summary: "Develops active noise cancellation techniques for pulse tube cryocooler vibrations in the CUORE neutrino experiment. While vibration management for particle physics detectors differs from propellant depot requirements, the vibration characterization data for pulse tube cryocoolers is relevant to assessing mechanical disturbance impacts on station operations. Pulse tube and Stirling cryocoolers generate periodic mechanical vibrations that could affect precision manufacturing operations or structural fatigue over 30-year station lifetime."

    summary: "Full history of ZBO concept development and reverse turbo-Brayton cryocooler progress. Documents the evolution from early concepts through ground demonstrations.

    journal: "NASA Technical Memorandum"
    relevance: critical
    summary: "Demonstrated 90K broad area cooling shield within MLI to reduce hot-side temperature seen by the 20K cryocooler. Carnot efficiency at LH2 temps is just 7%—meaning for every watt removed at 20K, approximately 14W must be rejected as waste heat. This thermodynamic constraint makes staged cooling essential and drives the enormous input power requirements (100-500 kW) for station-scale ZBO."

    journal: "SPIE / NASA"
    relevance: high
    summary: "Design and performance of the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument cryocooler—the most capable flight cryocooler operating today. Delivers approximately 0.25W of cooling at 6K using a pulse tube precooler (18K) cascaded with a Joule-Thomson loop (6K). Total input power approximately 500W. This system represents the absolute state of the art for flight cryocoolers and establishes the baseline from which scaling must proceed. The 0.25W capacity at cryogenic temperatures versus the 100-500W station requirement defines the 2-3 order of magnitude scaling gap."
