    title: "Asteroid Taxonomy from Cluster Analysis of Spectrometry and Albedo"
    authors: ["Max Mahlke", "Benoit Carry", "Pierre-Alexandre Mattei"]
    relevance: critical
    summary: "State-of-the-art asteroid classification system using spectroscopy and albedo data. Handles partial observations across visible and near-infrared wavelengths with probabilistic classifications that quantify uncertainty. Built from 2,983 observations of 2,125 asteroids—nearly 10x larger than prior datasets. Identifies 17 classes in three complexes (C, M, S) plus new Z-class. Released classification tool and designations for 6,000+ observations. Directly provides the taxonomic framework that prospecting satellite algorithms must implement."

    title: "Neural network for determining an asteroid mineral composition from reflectance spectra"
    authors: ["David Korda", "Antti Penttilä", "Arto Klami", "Tomáš Kohout"]
    relevance: critical
    summary: "Develops CNN for analyzing VNIR reflectance spectra to determine mineral and chemical compositions. Trained on RELAB and C-Tape databases with olivine, pyroxene, and meteorite samples. Individual predictions within 10 percentage-point intervals of ground truth. Applied to S-complex asteroids, predictions match ordinary chondrite compositions. Identifies apparent olivine depletion from space weathering—critical calibration factor for prospecting algorithms."

    summary: "Develops spectral clustering methodology for asteroid surface composition mapping using multi-filter imaging. Validated on Dawn/Ceres data, successfully identifying hydration features at 698 plus/minus 7 nm with 3.4% depth in Occator crater. Demonstrates the image processing pipeline, K-means clustering, and spectral feature extraction workflow applicable to prospecting satellite MapCam-style instruments."

    summary: "Describes OVIRS point spectrometer covering 0.4-4.3 microns for mapping Bennu's surface composition. Compact (17.8 kg), power efficient (8.8 W), and robust design provides the benchmark instrument specification for prospecting satellite spectrometers. Demonstrates spectral resolution and sensitivity achievable within tight mass/power budgets."

Establishes methodology for characterizing asteroid targets from remote sensing data before spacecraft arrival—directly informing what prospecting satellite algorithms must predict and validate."

Bulk density 1.19 g/cm3, dominant serpentine/magnetite/sulfide mineralogy. Essential for calibrating spectral-to-composition algorithms against actual asteroid material."

  - "CNNs can predict mineral composition from VNIR spectra within 10 percentage points of ground truth for silicate minerals"
  - "Space weathering causes apparent olivine depletion in spectra—algorithms must correct for this systematic bias"
  - "NIR albedo alone provides three distinct compositional groupings correlating with asteroid families, enabling coarse classification from photometry"
  - "OSIRIS-REx OVIRS demonstrates that a 17.8 kg, 8.8 W spectrometer achieves sufficient spectral range and resolution for composition mapping"

gaps_identified:
  - "No blind validation studies where spectral algorithms predict composition without access to ground truth—systematic accuracy/bias assessment lacking"
  - "Spectral unmixing algorithms validated only for silicate-rich (S-type) asteroids; carbonaceous (C-type) and metallic (M-type) compositions poorly validated"
  - "On-board vs ground processing algorithm comparison not conducted for asteroid composition analysis"
  - "Algorithm performance at degraded spectral resolution (matching prospecting satellite instrument constraints) not systematically evaluated"
  - "Training data predominantly from meteorite samples, not in-situ asteroid measurements—domain shift effects unknown"
  - "Real-time processing requirements for autonomous 30-day operation not addressed in current ML literature"
