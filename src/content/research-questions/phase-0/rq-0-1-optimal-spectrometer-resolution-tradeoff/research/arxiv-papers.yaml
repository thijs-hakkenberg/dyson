    title: "ASIME 2018 White Paper: In-Space Utilisation of Asteroids"
    authors: ["Amara Graps", "Jan Thimo Grundmann", "Juergen Blum", "Paolo Tanga"]
    relevance: critical
    summary: "Comprehensive white paper from the Asteroid Science Intersections with In-Space Mine Engineering workshop. Establishes the science requirements for asteroid resource characterization including compositional mapping, structural assessment, and volatile identification. Directly defines what spectrometer measurements are necessary for ISRU mission planning. Key finding: visible-NIR spectroscopy in the 0.4-2.5 um range is essential for distinguishing metallic, silicate, and carbonaceous asteroid types. Specifies that water/OH detection near 2.7-3.0 um is critical for volatile resource assessment. Provides the requirements framework against which spectrometer resolution trades must be evaluated."

    title: "ASIME 2016 White Paper: In-Space Utilisation of Asteroids"
    authors: ["Amara Graps", "Jan Thimo Grundmann", "Paolo Tanga", "Juergen Blum"]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Earlier workshop white paper establishing engineering requirements for asteroid mining operations. Documents the intersection between asteroid science knowledge and engineering needs for resource extraction. Identifies key spectral features that must be resolved for mining target selection: 1-um band complex for olivine/pyroxene discrimination, 2-um pyroxene band for composition, and UV/blue absorption edge for metallic iron content. Establishes that prospecting instruments must distinguish between S-type, C-type, M-type, and V-type asteroids with sufficient confidence to commit follow-up mission resources."

    title: "Spectral calibration and first results from the Hayabusa NIRS instrument at asteroid Itokawa"
    authors: ["Mehul Bhatt", "Ute Woehler", "Juergen Oberst", "Christian Wöhler"]
    relevance: critical
    summary: "Provides actual spacecraft spectrometer calibration and performance data from the Hayabusa NIRS instrument at asteroid Itokawa. Documents the challenges of in-flight spectral calibration including thermal drift, detector aging, and pointing-dependent response variations. NIRS operated in the 0.76-2.25 um range with ~25 nm spectral resolution. Key lessons: ground calibration was insufficient and in-flight recalibration using stellar observations was necessary. Thermal environment caused measurable wavelength shifts. Signal-to-noise degraded over mission life. These real-world performance constraints directly inform reliability requirements for the Dyson prospecting constellation's spectrometer design."

    title: "New method for determining the composition of S-type asteroids from noisy near-infrared reflectance spectra"
    authors: ["Juan A. Sanchez", "Vishnu Reddy", "Michael S. Kelley", "Edward A. Cloutis"]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Develops improved methods for extracting mineral composition from noisy NIR spectra of S-type asteroids. Demonstrates that olivine-pyroxene abundance ratios can be determined from band area ratios even with SNR as low as 20-30 in the 0.8-2.5 um range. Establishes empirical calibrations linking Band I center (~1 um), Band II center (~2 um), and Band Area Ratio (BAR) to mineralogy. Critical finding for resolution tradeoff: band center positions can be determined to within 0.01 um accuracy with 20 nm spectral sampling, but require SNR > 50 for reliable results. Coarser resolution (50 nm) significantly degrades band parameter accuracy for mixed mineralogies."

    title: "Constraining the Regolith Composition of Asteroid (16) Psyche via Near-Infrared Spectroscopy"
    authors: ["Anicia Arredondo", "Juan A. Sanchez", "Vishnu Reddy", "Andrea Cantillo"]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Applies NIR spectroscopic analysis to constrain the surface composition of metallic asteroid Psyche. Demonstrates techniques for identifying pyroxene and olivine signatures on metal-rich surfaces where spectral features are suppressed by metallic iron. Key finding: on metal-dominated surfaces, the 1-um and 2-um absorption features are shallow (2-5% depth) requiring high SNR (>100) for reliable detection. This has direct implications for prospecting satellite spectrometer design: metal-rich asteroids—the primary targets for Dyson swarm construction materials—present the most challenging spectroscopic detection scenario."

    title: "Asteroid Polarimetric-Phase Behavior in the Near-Infrared"
    authors: ["Joseph R. Masiero", "Joana Marqués Oliveira", "Tyler Barclay"]
    relevance: medium
    summary: "Characterizes NIR polarimetric phase behavior of asteroids as a complementary compositional diagnostic. Polarimetry provides independent constraints on surface texture, grain size, and albedo that can break degeneracies in reflectance spectroscopy. While not a primary instrument for the prospecting satellites, the results suggest that adding a simple polarimetric capability (rotating filter or Wollaston prism, <0.5 kg) could significantly improve compositional classification confidence, particularly for distinguishing high-metal from low-metal surfaces."

    title: "Composition of Near-Earth Asteroid (4179) Toutatis"
    authors: ["Vishnu Reddy", "Juan A. Sanchez", "Paul S. Hardersen"]
    relevance: medium
    summary: "Demonstrates complete compositional determination of NEA Toutatis using ground-based visible-NIR spectroscopy (0.4-2.5 um). Identifies the asteroid as an L-chondrite analog with specific olivine-to-pyroxene ratio and iron content. Achieves this classification using ~20 nm resolution observations with SNR ~80-100. Provides a concrete example of the minimum instrument performance needed for definitive asteroid typing—directly applicable as a benchmark for the prospecting satellite spectrometer specification."

    title: "DISCUS - The Deep Interior Scanning CubeSat mission to a rubble pile near-Earth asteroid"
    authors: ["Patrick Bambach", "Jens Biele", "Alain Herique", "Dirk Plettemeier"]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Presents a CubeSat mission concept for asteroid characterization including NIR spectroscopy from a 6U-12U platform. Demonstrates that meaningful asteroid spectroscopy can be achieved from sub-20 kg spacecraft. The DISCUS concept includes a compact NIR spectrometer (0.9-2.5 um, ~40 nm resolution) within a 1.5 kg, 3W instrument package. While resolution is coarser than ideal, the mission concept validates the feasibility of SmallSat-class asteroid spectroscopy and provides a lower bound on what miniaturized instruments can achieve. Mass and power figures directly inform the prospecting satellite trade space."

    title: "On-Orbit CubeSat Centrifuge for Asteroid Science and In-Situ Resource Utilization"
    authors: ["Jekan Thangavelautham", "Aman Chandra", "Erik Jensen"]
    relevance: medium
    summary: "Proposes a CubeSat concept for asteroid exploration with on-board sample analysis capability. While focused on in-situ analysis rather than remote sensing, the mission architecture demonstrates how small spacecraft can be designed for asteroid rendezvous and characterization. The centrifuge concept for sample processing illustrates the broader trend toward miniaturized, autonomous asteroid science platforms. Relevant to the constellation architecture as a potential follow-up mission type that could validate remote spectroscopic classifications."

    title: "Survey Simulations of a New Near-Earth Asteroid Detection System"
    authors: ["A. Mainzer", "T. Grav", "J. Bauer", "R. M. Cutri"]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Presents survey simulation results for a space-based NEA detection system (precursor to NEOCam/NEO Surveyor). Establishes detection rates, survey completeness timelines, and instrument performance requirements for a space-based asteroid survey. Key findings for prospecting satellite design: a single space-based platform with 50 cm aperture achieves ~90% completeness for >140 m NEAs within 12 years. The spectral characterization requirements derived here—broadband photometry sufficient for taxonomic classification but not detailed mineralogy—define the lower bound of what survey-mode instruments must achieve. Constellation of 50 satellites with dedicated spectrometers would dramatically exceed this capability."

    title: "Neural network for determining an asteroid mineral composition from reflectance spectra"
    authors: ["David Korda", "Tomas Kohout", "Antti Penttila"]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Develops neural network methods for determining asteroid mineral composition directly from reflectance spectra. Trains on laboratory mineral mixtures from the RELAB database and validates against meteorite spectra. Achieves olivine-pyroxene ratio determination within 10% accuracy using spectra with 20-50 nm resolution. Key finding for on-board processing: the trained network is computationally lightweight (inference in milliseconds on modest hardware) and could feasibly run on radiation-hardened processors for autonomous spectral classification. Demonstrates that ML approaches can compensate partially for reduced spectral resolution, potentially enabling coarser (50 nm) instruments to achieve classification accuracy approaching that of 20 nm instruments for common mineral assemblages."

    title: "The debiased compositional distribution of the near-Earth objects from the MITHNEOS survey"
    authors: ["Mikael Marsset", "Francesca DeMeo", "Richard P. Binzel"]
    relevance: high
    summary: "Presents the most comprehensive debiased spectral survey of near-Earth objects, establishing the ground-truth compositional distribution against which prospecting satellite performance must be validated. The MITHNEOS survey used 0.8-2.5 um spectroscopy at ~20 nm resolution to classify >1000 NEOs. Key results: S-complex dominates (65%), followed by C-complex (20%), X-complex (8%), and others. Approximately 25% of surveyed NEOs show spectral evidence of hydration features. Establishes the baseline classification taxonomy and population statistics that the prospecting constellation must reproduce and extend. The 20 nm resolution achieved here serves as the empirical standard for NEO compositional surveys."

    relevance: medium
    summary: "Recent spectral analysis of the Tianwen-2 mission target asteroid Kamo'oalewa, demonstrating current state-of-the-art in asteroid compositional determination from spectroscopic data. Applies modern spectral analysis techniques including band parameter extraction and spectral unmixing to characterize a small (~40 m) quasi-satellite of Earth. Relevant as a demonstration of what spectral analysis can achieve for small NEA targets similar to those the prospecting constellation would survey."

    title: "Asteroid Photometry"
    authors: ["Jian-Yang Li", "Larry A. Lebofsky", "Paul Helfenstein"]
    relevance: medium
    summary: "Comprehensive review of asteroid photometric techniques and their constraints on surface properties. Documents photometric phase curves, albedo determination, and roughness characterization from broadband observations. Establishes that broadband photometry (BVRI filters) provides taxonomic classification at ~70% accuracy, while spectroscopy at 20 nm resolution achieves >90% accuracy. The gap between photometric and spectroscopic classification accuracy quantifies the value of the spectrometer investment on the prospecting satellites. Also documents photometric calibration requirements that apply to any space-based asteroid observation system."
