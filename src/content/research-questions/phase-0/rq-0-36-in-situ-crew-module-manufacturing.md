## Background

The modular human-rating approach from rq-0-18 specifies crew kits that can be installed on transport vehicles as needed. Initially, these kits would be launched from Earth. However, as the Material Processing Station matures and ISRU manufacturing capability develops, there is an opportunity to manufacture crew module kits in-situ — potentially at significantly lower cost and with the ability to produce additional kits as the fleet expands.

## Why This Matters

Earth-launched crew modules cost approximately $50-100M per kit including development, manufacturing, and launch to L4/L5. If the Material Processing Station can produce equivalent modules from asteroid-derived materials:
- Additional vehicles can be crew-rated without Earth launch costs
- Damaged or worn crew modules can be replaced on-site
- Design improvements can be incorporated into new kits without re-launching from Earth
- The 3-vehicle crew-rated limit becomes a choice, not a constraint

However, crew modules require higher manufacturing precision and quality assurance than structural components, and life support systems include electronics and polymers not easily produced from asteroid feedstock.

## Key Considerations

- Structural pressure vessel components could be manufactured from asteroid-derived metals
- Life support systems require specialized components (filters, membranes, electronics)
- Environmental control systems need Earth-sourced or high-purity ISRU materials
- Quality assurance for human-rated hardware is significantly more stringent
- Radiation shielding could use ISRU water, reducing launched mass
- Sealing and pressure integrity testing in microgravity manufacturing

## Research Directions

1. **Component decomposition**: Break down crew module kits into components, classifying each as ISRU-manufacturable, partially ISRU, or Earth-sourced.

2. **Critical path analysis**: Identify which non-ISRU components drive the minimum Earth-launch mass for crew kits.

3. **Quality assurance framework**: Define inspection and testing requirements for ISRU-manufactured crew module components, comparing against Earth-manufactured equivalents.

4. **Timeline assessment**: Estimate when Material Processing Station capabilities would mature sufficiently to produce crew module structural components.

5. **Hybrid manufacturing design**: Design crew module kits optimized for ISRU structural fabrication with Earth-sourced critical subsystems (electronics, life support membranes, seals).
