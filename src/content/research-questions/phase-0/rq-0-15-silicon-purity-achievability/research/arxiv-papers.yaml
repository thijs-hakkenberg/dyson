key_findings:
  - "UMG-Si at 4N-5N purity achieves viable solar cell efficiencies (15-18%) through metallurgical route alone"
  - "Float zone crystal growth parameters (growth angle, meniscus shape) are gravity-dependent and will differ in microgravity"
  - "Iron and transition metal impurities are most detrimental to cell efficiency, even at ppb levels"
  - "Multi-junction and nanowire cell architectures may relax silicon purity requirements"
  - "Directional solidification can achieve 5N-6N purity through controlled impurity segregation"
  - "Radiation-induced degradation in space may dominate over initial purity-related efficiency losses"
