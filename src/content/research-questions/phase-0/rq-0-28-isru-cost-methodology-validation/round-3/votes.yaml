    reasoning: Provides the most concrete numerical model with worked estimates for each cost term, a clear table comparing revised vs. current estimates, explicit failure modes that could invalidate the model, and actionable recommendations including three-scenario budgeting. The 5-term cost decomposition (seed, bootstrap, import, oversight, risk reserve) is well-defined and defensible. The observation that Phase 3a's correction is larger because linear scaling error grows with unit count is mathematically sound. The risk reserve multiplier approach is a pragmatic way to handle deep uncertainty.

    reasoning: 'Makes several genuinely novel and important contributions: the ''Space-Grade Fallacy'' insight that swarm architectures should use disposable industrial-grade components rather than rad-hardened parts is a critical architectural insight with enormous cost implications. The distinction between importing finished chips vs. raw wafers with in-situ lithography is exactly the kind of design trade that determines whether the project is feasible. The ''Ergotic Cost Model'' concept of transitioning from dollar-based to energy-based accounting for Phase 3 is conceptually correct. The software/information assurance point as a hidden cost driver is well-taken. However, the revised Phase 3a estimate of $40-80T seems less rigorously derived than Claude''s and the response could benefit from more explicit derivation of its numbers.'

    reasoning: The strongest methodological contribution of the three. Rather than just providing numbers, it delivers a complete validation workflow with concrete timelines (BOM-to-buckets mapping, import ledger, throughput model, yield/attrition Monte Carlo) that a program office could actually execute. The 4-term cost model (seed + imports + ops + attrition) is clean and implementable. The 'escape velocity condition' concept is a crucial validation metric. The more conservative reduction estimates (3-8x for Phase 2, 5-30x for Phase 3a) reflect appropriate epistemic humility. The tile class decomposition (local-manufacturable, hybrid, imported) is an excellent framing for the architecture trade. Most pragmatic and actionable of the three responses.

    reasoning: This response is outstanding. It provides the specific mathematical framework requested ('C_total = C_seed + ...') and populates it with plausible, defensible numbers. It directly addresses the 'Vitamin Problem' quantitatively and offers a clear comparison between the old linear model and the new capacity model. The breakdown of risks is also highly valuable.

    targetId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: This response introduces critical conceptual shifts that complement Claude's numerical model. The distinction between 'Space Grade' and 'Industrial Grade' reliability is a massive cost driver that was previously overlooked. The proposal to move from economic modeling to 'Ergotic' (energy-time) modeling is theoretically sound for Phase 3. It effectively tackles the 'Vitamin Problem' by proposing a specific technical solution (low-res lithography).

    targetId: gpt-5-2
    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: This response is solid and correct, but it feels slightly repetitive of the concepts already established in previous rounds or better articulated by the other two models in this round. While the 'BOM-to-buckets' validation workflow is a good practical step, the response lacks the concrete numerical estimates provided by Claude and the specific architectural insights (like the lithography cliff) provided by Gemini.

    targetId: claude-opus-4-6
    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: Strong shift to a capacity-based framework and provides a usable cost decomposition with explicit terms and scenario sensitivity. However, several numerical assumptions are weakly justified (e.g., $/kg to operational zone, seed foundry counts/costs, oversight sizing) and some scaling claims (logarithmic) are asserted without a throughput/yield model; risk reserve application is also somewhat ad hoc.

    targetId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: 'Good conceptual points: vitamin/import floor, dropping space-grade requirements for swarm units, and highlighting software assurance as a major cost driver. But it drifts into less actionable energetics framing without tying back to a defensible cost methodology, and the revised budget numbers appear largely speculative with limited linkage to mass/throughput/import ledgers.'

    reasoning: 'Most methodologically grounded: replaces linear procurement with an implementable seed+imports+ops+attrition model, explicitly incorporates replication/yield/attrition dynamics, and proposes a concrete validation workflow (BOM mapping, import ledger, throughput model, Monte Carlo). It advances the discussion toward falsifiable artifacts rather than relying on unsupported point estimates.'

    reasoning: 'All three responses converge on the same fundamental conclusion: the linear scaling methodology is invalid for ISRU-dominated phases and must be replaced with a capacity-based model decomposed into seed/imports/operations/attrition terms. The key open questions (import fraction, semiconductor localization, yield, autonomy maturity) have been clearly identified and bounded. Concrete numerical estimates, architectural recommendations, and a validation workflow have been provided. Further rounds would likely produce diminishing returns—the discussion has moved from ''is the methodology wrong?'' (Round 1) to ''here is the replacement methodology with numbers and a validation plan'' (Round 3). The next productive step is execution (building the import ledger and throughput model), not further discussion.'
  - modelId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: The discussion has successfully transitioned from identifying the problem (linear scaling is wrong) to providing a concrete solution (capacity-based costing + vitamin analysis). Claude provided a full mathematical model with numbers, and Gemini provided the necessary architectural philosophy (industrial grade vs. space grade). Further discussion would likely just be refining these specific numbers, which requires external data not available in this context.
  - modelId: gpt-5-2
    vote: CONTINUE
    reasoning: A solid replacement methodology is emerging, but the discussion still lacks the key quantitative artifacts (import/vitamin ledger, throughput bottlenecks, yield/attrition distributions) needed to validate specific Phase 2/3 cost ranges. Another round focused on producing those inputs and reconciling assumptions would be beneficial.
