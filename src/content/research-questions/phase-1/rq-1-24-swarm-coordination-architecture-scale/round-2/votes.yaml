    reasoning: Exceptionally strong response. The predictive state sharing protocol is the standout contribution—the bandwidth reduction from 500 Mbps to 2 Mbps via ephemeris propagation rather than continuous state transmission is a genuinely enabling insight. The quantified resource requirements, explicit edge case analysis (especially the counterintuitive but correct prohibition on uncoordinated collision avoidance maneuvers), and the clear articulation of why no entity can have real-time global state elevate this beyond the other responses. The recalculation stumble on sector coordinator counts is minor and self-corrected.

    reasoning: 'The SWaP argument for heterogeneous hardware is compelling and fills a real gap from Round 1—the mass budget implications of rotating coordinators on collector hardware are correctly identified as a showstopper at scale. The Shepherd/Flock model with spatial roaming is well-conceived. However, the response is less rigorous than the other two: the 1:2,500 ratio needs more justification, the ''Passive Safe Mode'' for lost units (feathering solar sails, becoming trackable debris) is underspecified, and the octree spatial partitioning needs more detail on how it handles the non-Euclidean geometry of orbital mechanics. Still a valuable contribution that grounds the discussion in hardware reality.'

    reasoning: 'Clean, well-structured architecture that correctly identifies the keystone insight: orbital lane design is as fundamental as network topology. The traffic engineering approach in orbital element space is the right framing—making ''who can collide'' small by design rather than trying to screen all pairs. The cellular network analogy for beam coordination is apt. The concrete spec implications section is actionable. Slightly less novel than Opus''s predictive state model or Gemini''s SWaP analysis, but the most operationally complete and implementation-ready of the three.'

    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: This response provides the most comprehensive and technically grounded solution. It correctly identifies predictive state sharing as the critical enabler for bandwidth reduction and addresses the 'hardest' problem of light-time latency across the swarm. The specific breakdown of layers, the handling of edge cases (especially boundary collisions), and the quantified resource requirements make this a highly actionable proposal.
  - voterId: gemini-3-pro
    targetId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: This response introduces a crucial hardware reality check regarding SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power). The argument against a homogeneous swarm (where every unit carries coordinator hardware) is economically and physically sound for a project of this scale. The proposal for 'Shepherd' nodes and dynamic spatial partitioning complements the software-focused responses well, adding necessary engineering constraints.

    targetId: gpt-5-2
    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: This response is solid and aligns well with the general consensus, particularly regarding the 'Orbital Federation' concept and event-driven telemetry. However, it feels slightly less innovative than Claude's predictive state model or Gemini's hardware heterogeneity argument. It effectively summarizes good practices but doesn't push the architectural definition as far as the others.

    targetId: claude-opus-4-6
    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: Strong framing around physical latency and eventual consistency; good ideas (predictive state sharing, overlap zones, explicit safe modes). However, it contains internal inconsistencies and shaky quantification (e.g., 1 AU orbital period misstatement, coordinator count recalculation confusion, optimistic propagation/accuracy claims, and some bandwidth math assumptions). Valuable direction but needs correction/tightening to be fully reliable.

    targetId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Directly addresses a key missing dimension (SWaP/manufacturing economics) and proposes a coherent heterogeneous 'shepherd/flock' architecture with spatial partitioning and exception-based telemetry. Handles drift/roaming and failure modes with overlap/passive safety. Some technical details are hand-wavy (e.g., perturbations cited, sector geometry choice), but the architectural contribution is clear and practical.
  - voterId: gpt-5-2
    targetId: gpt-5-2
    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Well-structured, scalable hierarchy with clear authority boundaries, event-driven/aggregated comms, DTN use, and explicit collision-avoidance scaling via lanes/partitions. Good failure containment and power-beam coordination separation (local phasing vs hierarchical scheduling). Less numerically concrete than Opus, but internally consistent and advances the discussion toward spec-level implications.

    reasoning: 'All three responses converge strongly on the same fundamental architecture (hierarchical, orbit-aligned, locality-first) with complementary contributions: Opus provides the enabling communication protocol (predictive state), Gemini provides the hardware design constraint (heterogeneous Shepherd/Flock), and GPT provides the operational framework (orbital lanes + federation). The key open questions from Round 1 have been substantively addressed. Further rounds would likely yield diminishing returns—the remaining open issues (spatial partitioning algorithm selection, inter-shell coordination, graceful scaling) are implementation details best resolved through simulation and prototyping rather than additional architectural discussion.'
  - modelId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: The discussion has reached a very strong synthesis. We have a consensus on the hierarchical topology (Claude/GPT), a critical hardware differentiation strategy (Gemini), and a specific protocol for handling latency via predictive state (Claude). Further rounds are unlikely to yield better high-level architectural insights without moving into specific simulation coding or detailed subsystem design.
  - modelId: gpt-5-2
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: 'Across the three responses, the discussion converges on a consistent solution space: hierarchical, locality-first coordination; orbit-aligned partitioning/lanes; aggregation + exception-based comms; heterogeneous coordinator options; and explicit degraded safe modes. Further rounds would likely be incremental unless new constraints (threat model, propulsion/Δv limits, specific comms ranges, or power-beam physics) are introduced.'
