    reasoning: Exceptional response that makes the critical insight that orbital configuration IS the coordination architecture. The five-tier physically-grounded hierarchy is well-justified, the orbital element-space partitioning for collision avoidance is a genuinely superior approach to Cartesian spatial methods, and the graceful degradation table is concrete and actionable. The bandwidth analysis is more conservative and better justified than the simulation's estimates. The argument for purpose-built regional coordinators is compelling and well-quantified (0.01-0.05% of swarm mass). The collision probability budget concept is a valuable systems engineering contribution.

    reasoning: Solid response with a clear, implementable architecture. The 'Federated Constellation' framing is effective and the three-tier model is well-structured. The exception-based reporting strategy with heartbeat hash aggregation is a practical bandwidth solution. The strong advocacy for dedicated Shepherd-class spacecraft is well-reasoned. However, it's less technically deep than the other two responses—it doesn't engage as thoroughly with orbital mechanics coupling, the collision avoidance math is hand-waved somewhat, and the three-tier model may be insufficient at 10M+ scale. Still a strong contribution that advances the discussion.

    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Comprehensive and well-organized response with excellent operational framing ('air-traffic system with local autonomy'). The five-layer control hierarchy is well-defined with clear authority boundaries. The 'conjunction responsibility is local and contractual' concept is an important accountability framework. The bandwidth math is concrete and realistic. The security model concerns (Sybil resistance, key management) are a unique and valuable addition that other responses missed. The 'pause-and-safe' failure containment philosophy is sound. Slightly less novel than Claude's orbital mechanics coupling insight but arguably more immediately implementable.

    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Strong systems-level treatment that correctly couples coordination to orbital mechanics, proposes a physically grounded multi-tier hierarchy, addresses collision avoidance scaling with orbital-element partitioning, and includes graceful degradation modes plus realistic bandwidth budgeting. Actionable and advances the discussion materially.

    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Solid, implementable three-tier federation aligned with orbital locality, introduces dedicated 'Shepherd' nodes, and emphasizes exception-based reporting. Some claims are a bit hand-wavy (e.g., O(N^2) at sector scale, specific bandwidth reduction), but overall it’s coherent and useful.

    reasoning: 'Well-structured and comprehensive: clear authority boundaries, envelope-based aggregation, event-driven comms, local safety invariants, and failure containment. Good scaling intuition and spec-ready recommendations, though less anchored to orbital-mechanics specifics than Claude.'

    reasoning: 'All three responses converge strongly on the same core architecture: hierarchical coordination with local safety closure, purpose-built coordinator nodes, envelope-based aggregated reporting, and physical/orbital partitioning. The key points of consensus are clear—no centralized real-time control, dedicated coordinator hardware, event-driven comms, and graceful degradation. The remaining differences are implementation details (3 vs 5 tiers, exact cluster sizes) that are appropriately resolved in detailed design rather than further discussion. The discussion has produced a robust, well-justified architectural framework.'

  - modelId: gpt-5-2
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: All three converge on the key resolution (hierarchical, locality-based control with local safety closure, aggregation, and dedicated/eligible coordinators). Remaining work is implementation detail (protocols, arbitration, security), not conceptual architecture, so further rounds are optional rather than necessary.
