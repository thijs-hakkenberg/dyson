    reasoning: Exceptionally thorough and well-structured response. The tiered approach (salvage → graveyard → passive safety) is rigorously justified with specific Δv numbers, economic analysis, phased salvage infrastructure rollout, and concrete design implications including a mass impact table. The graveyard orbit band selections (0.15-0.25 AU and 1.8-2.2 AU) are well-reasoned. The automatic passivation watchdog timer and retroreflector proposals for uncontrolled derelicts are practical. The 3-5% Δv reserve recommendation is well-calibrated. Strong rejection of solar impact with clear physics. One of the strongest technical responses in this discussion.

    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Strong response that arrives at the same correct tiered framework with some distinctive and valuable contributions. The 'Dead Man's Switch' concept using thermal degradation links for fail-safe tank venting is a genuinely novel and practical safety proposal not covered by the other responses. The emphasis on xenon as the primary recoverable commodity is well-argued. The 'Relative-Velocity Nulling' framing for graveyard disposal is a useful conceptual lens. Slightly less detailed than Opus on graveyard orbit specifics and salvage infrastructure phasing, but the unique contributions (thermal fail-safe, SSI specification) add real value to the discussion.

    reasoning: Excellent response with the strongest operational framework of the three. The corridor-based graveyard definition (rather than orbit-class-based) is the most operationally mature framing and is a genuinely important insight for heliocentric operations. The Class A/B/C/D decision tree is the most implementable disposal taxonomy proposed. The xenon recovery policy with strict health criteria is pragmatically wise. The 'what to model next' section provides a clear research roadmap. The suggestion for a 'Dyson Traffic Management Standard' is forward-looking. Slightly less detailed on specific graveyard orbit parameters but compensates with superior operational policy structure.

    reasoning: This response offers the most comprehensive and realistic breakdown of the problem. It correctly identifies the economic drivers (xenon and aluminum value), proposes a sensible phased implementation plan (Phase 1A/1B/1C) that acknowledges infrastructure won't exist immediately, and provides specific, actionable design requirements (watchdog timers, retroreflectors). The tiered approach is robust.

    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Strong engineering focus. The 'Dead Man's Switch' concept for thermal valve failure is a brilliant, specific technical detail that addresses the critical safety risk of pressurized derelicts. The rejection of solar impact is well-argued. The distinction between 'graveyard orbit' and 'relative velocity nulling' is a crucial astrodynamic insight for heliocentric operations.
  - voterId: gemini-3-pro
    targetId: gpt-5-2
    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: The response is solid and agrees with the others on the main points (salvage first, solar impact is bad). However, it feels slightly less specific than the other two. The 'Class A/B/C/D' breakdown is useful, but the specific engineering mitigations (like the thermal valve idea in Gemini or the phased infrastructure in Claude) are less developed here. It is a good summary but adds less unique value than the others.
  - voterId: gpt-5-2
    targetId: claude-opus-4-6
    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Provides a clear tiered protocol (salvage→graveyard→passive safety), correctly rejects solar impact on Δv grounds, quantifies reserves/Δv, includes phased infrastructure plan and concrete design implications (interfaces, autonomous passivation, tracking aids). Mostly coherent and actionable; minor quibbles on some numeric assumptions but overall strong systems answer.
  - voterId: gpt-5-2
    targetId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: Gets the core trade right (RtD salvage primary, heliocentric graveyard contingency, solar impact infeasible) and adds useful interface requirements. However it contains some weaker/hand-wavy elements (e.g., “planetary protection” framing for Earth return in this context, SRP ‘parking’ stability claims, and a questionable fail-open prop valve concept that could introduce hazards). Adequate but less rigorous.

    reasoning: 'Well-structured and implementable: corridor-based graveyard definition (more appropriate than arbitrary heliocentric bands), explicit class decision tree, realistic stance on solar impact as rare exception, and solid design requirements (limp-home, capture interfaces, passivation/trackability). Good balance of feasibility, scaling, and operational policy.'

    reasoning: 'All three responses converge strongly on the same fundamental architecture: depot-return salvage as primary, heliocentric graveyard as backstop, passive safety for uncontrolled failures, and rejection of solar impact as baseline. The key design parameters are well-bounded (300-750 m/s Δv reserve, standardized salvage interfaces, autonomous passivation). Each response adds unique value (Opus: detailed phasing and mass budgets; Gemini: thermal fail-safe and SSI; GPT: corridor-based graveyard and decision tree taxonomy). Together they form a comprehensive and actionable disposal protocol. Further rounds would likely yield diminishing returns on the core architectural decisions, though the modeling tasks identified by GPT-5.2 represent valuable follow-on work outside the scope of this discussion.'
  - modelId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: 'All three models have converged on a unanimous and technically sound consensus: reject solar impact, prioritize depot return for salvage (specifically Xenon and electronics), and use a heliocentric graveyard drift as a fallback. They have provided specific design requirements (passivation, standard interfaces, delta-v reserves). No further debate is needed to reach a decision for the CDR.'
  - modelId: gpt-5-2
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: Across the strongest responses there is clear convergence on a tiered approach with depot-return salvage as default, corridor-based heliocentric graveyard as backstop, and robust passivation/trackability for failures; remaining differences are implementation details rather than unresolved fundamentals.
