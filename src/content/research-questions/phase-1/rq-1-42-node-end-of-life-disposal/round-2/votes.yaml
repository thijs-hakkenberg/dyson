    reasoning: Exceptional response. The quantitative SRP analysis (0.79 m/s/day, ~23.6 m/s/month) grounds the drift-bias concept in real physics. The critical insight that passive drift is non-deterministic and depends on tumble geometry is an important corrective to Round 1 optimism. The 250g hardware package (survival beacon, retroreflector, mechanical sail bias, hardcoded disposal receiver) is concrete, costed, and actionable. The observation that 'the graveyard is not a parking lot—it is a slow-moving river' is the most important strategic insight across all responses and correctly reframes the long-term tracking problem as primary rather than secondary. The tiered architecture (Tier 0 through Tier 3) is well-ordered by failure severity.

    reasoning: 'The bistable sail deployment concept and watchdog passivation circuit are sound engineering ideas that complement the other responses. However, this response is notably less rigorous than the other two: it lacks quantitative analysis of SRP drift rates, doesn''t address the non-deterministic nature of tumble-state drift, and the claim of ''thousands of kilometers'' separation over one orbital period needs substantiation. The spectral coating idea for optical tagging is creative but less practical than retroreflectors for ranging. The passivation ''kill sequence'' that permanently shunts solar arrays is aggressive—it eliminates any possibility of recovery or beacon operation, which conflicts with the tracking requirements the other responses correctly prioritize. Overall adequate but less developed.'

    reasoning: 'Strong systems-engineering response that advances the discussion in several important ways. The reframing from fixed graveyard bands to ''disposal manifolds'' defined by mean-motion divergence and MOID envelopes is the most operationally sophisticated treatment of the separation problem. The ΔV reality check—sizing for a modest divergence kick rather than a full 0.05 AU transfer—is pragmatic and correctly matched to the propulsion constraints. The EOL state machine specification (tripwires, trend triggers, deterministic tier selection) is implementable. The simulation priorities are well-chosen and actionable. The ''two-layer trackability'' requirement aligns well with Claude''s hardware proposals. Minor weakness: could have been more specific on hardware mass/power budgets like Claude was.'

    reasoning: Excellent response that adds necessary quantitative rigor to the SRP drift concept. The proposal for a 'Tier 0' mechanical bias and the specific hardware mass budget (250g) transforms the abstract idea into a concrete engineering requirement. The emphasis on catalog maintenance as the primary long-term challenge is insightful.

    reasoning: Strong engineering proposal. The specific recommendation for 'bistable sail deployment' using stored strain energy is a perfect hardware solution to the problem of unpowered disposal. The addition of passive optical tagging (spectral coatings) addresses the tracking challenge effectively.

    reasoning: Solid contribution, particularly the distinction between 'graveyard bands' and 'disposal manifolds' based on mean-motion divergence. This adds orbital mechanics nuance that complements the hardware-focused responses of the other models.

    reasoning: Strong systems-level answer that operationalizes SRP drift with designed fail states, adds quantitative SRP estimates, and correctly elevates long-term catalog/trackability as the key scaling constraint. Tiered approach (mechanical bias, autonomous, commanded, accept+track) is actionable and addresses failure modes where propulsion/ADCS are what fail.

    reasoning: Good core idea (bistable sail defaulting to a disposal configuration; watchdog/passivation) and recognizes tracking difficulty, but some technical claims are shaky/hand-wavy (e.g., SRP acceleration magnitude, “spiral outward” determinism from full-face-on without attitude/orbit coupling details). Optical tagging helps but is less robust than explicit beacon/retroreflector concepts.

    reasoning: 'Well-reasoned and scalable: frames disposal as exiting operational phase space via SRP-biased drift, uses mean-motion/geometry rather than a fixed graveyard band, and specifies autonomy triggers, passivation, and post-failure observability. Good balance of robustness (doesn’t assume working propulsion) with practical enhancements (small single-burn kick when available).'

    reasoning: 'Strong convergence across all three responses on the core architecture: SRP-biased passive drift as primary disposal mechanism, tiered protocols based on failure severity, mechanical fail-safe sail configurations, passivation requirements, and persistent trackability. The key remaining disagreements are productive design trades (e.g., graveyard bands vs disposal manifolds, kill-switch aggressiveness) rather than fundamental architectural disputes. The discussion has produced actionable hardware specs (250g disposal package), quantitative SRP analysis, operational protocols, and prioritized simulation tasks. A third round would likely yield diminishing returns—the next productive step is the simulation work all respondents identified.'

    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: The discussion has reached a strong technical consensus. All three models independently converged on a 'Fail-Safe Sail' architecture that utilizes mechanical biases (springs/bistable booms) to ensure failed nodes passively drift via Solar Radiation Pressure. The hardware requirements (mechanical defaults, passive optical/RF tracking aids, watchdog circuits) are now clearly defined. Further discussion would likely require physics simulation rather than conversational debate.

    reasoning: 'The top responses converge on a coherent, implementable architecture: fail-safe SRP-driven drift as primary disposal, tiered autonomy/command fallback, mandatory passivation, and designed-in long-term trackability. Remaining gaps are mainly detailed parameter tuning/simulation, not conceptual direction, so further rounds are optional rather than necessary.'
