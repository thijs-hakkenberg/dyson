## Background

The economic case for in-space resource utilization (ISRU) versus Earth-based manufacturing depends on a complex interplay between launch costs, production rates, and capital equipment mass. For thin-film photovoltaic collectors specifically, this tradeoff determines when the project should transition from launching Earth-manufactured collectors to deploying in-space thin-film deposition facilities.

Current launch costs have decreased dramatically over the past decade and continue trending downward. Simultaneously, in-space manufacturing concepts have matured from theoretical proposals to demonstration-ready systems. The crossover point—where in-space production becomes more economical than Earth launch—is a moving target that depends on assumptions about future cost trajectories for both approaches.

Research paper arXiv:2107.05872 analyzes ISRU economics for space-based solar power systems, modeling production facility mass, operating costs, and breakeven analysis against launch alternatives. Paper arXiv:1810.04749 provides complementary analysis of thin-film deposition in space environments, including equipment requirements and processing constraints.

## Why This Matters

This question carries **high priority** because it directly determines Phase 1/Phase 2 transition planning and infrastructure investment strategy.

**Investment Timing Decisions**: ISRU facilities require substantial development lead time. If the crossover point is near-term, development must begin immediately. If distant, resources may be better allocated to expanding Earth-based production capacity.

**Architecture Selection**: The optimal system architecture differs substantially between Earth-launch and ISRU scenarios. Earth-launch favors highly optimized, compact collector designs that minimize launch mass. ISRU favors designs that minimize processing complexity and equipment mass, potentially accepting lower collector performance.

**Risk Distribution**: Earth-based manufacturing represents proven technology with well-understood cost structures. ISRU introduces technological risks but potentially offers long-term cost advantages. Understanding the crossover timing informs risk management strategy.

**Asteroid Mining Integration**: Thin-film deposition ISRU couples with asteroid mining operations that provide raw materials. The economics of thin-film deposition affect asteroid mining mission requirements and vice versa.

**Policy and Partnership Implications**: Near-term crossover may justify partnerships with commercial asteroid mining ventures. Distant crossover may favor continued investment in Earth-based supply chains and launch capacity.

## Key Considerations

**Launch Cost Trajectories**: SpaceX Starship and similar next-generation launch systems promise costs below $100/kg to LEO, with potential for further reductions. However, launch costs to operational orbits (L1, heliocentric) include transfer propulsion costs that may not decrease proportionally.

**ISRU Facility Mass Scaling**: Thin-film deposition equipment mass scales with production rate. Small demonstration facilities may have unfavorable mass ratios, while large-scale facilities achieve better efficiency. The crossover point depends on facility scale.

**Material Sourcing Costs**: ISRU economics include asteroid prospecting, capture, and processing costs. These costs vary dramatically depending on asteroid selection, capture method, and processing efficiency—all areas of active uncertainty.

**Learning Curve Effects**: Both Earth-based production and ISRU operations will benefit from learning curve cost reductions as cumulative production increases. The relative learning rates affect when crossover occurs and how rapidly the advantage shifts post-crossover.

**Vacuum Processing Advantages**: Thin-film deposition in space vacuum may achieve better quality or efficiency than Earth-based processing, potentially producing higher-value collectors that shift the economic comparison.

**Infrastructure Amortization**: ISRU requires substantial infrastructure investment (asteroid capture systems, processing stations, depot networks) that must be amortized across produced units. Economic crossover depends on total planned production volume.

## Research Directions

1. **Dynamic Crossover Modeling**: Develop models that track crossover timing under various scenarios for launch cost reduction, ISRU technology maturation, and production volume growth.

2. **Facility Design Optimization**: Design thin-film deposition facilities optimized for space operation and determine their mass, power, and throughput characteristics to ground economic models.

3. **Integrated Supply Chain Analysis**: Model the complete supply chain for ISRU-based thin-film production including material acquisition, facility operation, and collector deployment to identify cost drivers and optimization opportunities.

4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Identify which parameters most strongly affect crossover timing and prioritize research and demonstration activities accordingly.

5. **Phased Transition Planning**: Develop transition strategies that manage risk by gradually shifting production from Earth to space as ISRU costs decrease and confidence increases.
