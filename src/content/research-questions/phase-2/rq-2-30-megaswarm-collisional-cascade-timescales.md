## Background

Lacki (2025, arxiv:2504.21151) analyzes the long-term fate of Dyson megaswarms without active maintenance, finding that collisional cascades destroy a minimal swarm at 1 AU around a solar-type star in approximately **41,000 years**. Even with an average inter-element collision time of ~1 million years, the stochastic nature of early collisions triggers cascading fragmentation far sooner. This research directly challenges the implicit assumption in Project Dyson's planning that the swarm, once built, remains structurally viable over indefinite timescales.

While existing questions (rq-1-6, rq-2-3) address collision avoidance during the 10-25 year operational deployment phase, they do not model the **century-to-millennium-scale degradation trajectory** of the full swarm under realistic failure modes: guidance system degradation, propellant depletion, control software obsolescence, and cumulative debris generation from micrometeorite impacts.

## Why This Matters

Project Dyson's Phase 2 swarm represents a civilization-scale investment ($50T+). Understanding how long it survives as a functioning energy collector—and what maintenance cadence keeps it viable—directly determines:

- **Return on investment timescales**: If the swarm degrades to non-functionality in 10,000 years without maintenance, but requires 500 years to build, the economics change fundamentally
- **Maintenance infrastructure sizing**: The station-keeping, repair, and debris cleanup infrastructure must be sized for the actual degradation rate, not just the deployment rate
- **Design for graceful degradation**: Knowing that cascade timescales are ~41,000 years for uncontrolled swarms informs how much margin active control provides and what failure modes trigger cascade onset
- **Governance and institutional requirements**: Multi-century maintenance demands institutional continuity far beyond any existing human organization (connects to rq-0-29)

Lacki's finding that Jupiter's gravitational perturbations alone destroy a 1 AU megaswarm in a few hundred thousand years adds urgency: even partial loss of station-keeping capability on a subset of elements could accelerate cascade onset to within human-relevant timescales.

## Key Considerations

**Lacki's Key Results (arxiv:2504.21151):**
- Minimal occulting swarm at 1 AU around Sun-like star: 340 elements
- Average collision time for randomized velocities: ~1 million years
- Cascade destruction time: ~41,000 years (much sooner due to stochastic early collisions)
- Ring-based architecture (elements in altitude-separated rings): extends intrabelt collision time to tens of thousands of years
- Jupiter perturbation timescale: hundreds of thousands of years
- Red giant hosts (25 R☉): cascade time extends to 5.3 billion years
- M-dwarf hosts (0.1 R☉): cascade time collapses to ~4 months

**Project Dyson's Different Regime:**
- Our swarm is far larger than minimal (billions of elements, not hundreds)
- Elements have active station-keeping (ion/electrospray propulsion, solar sailing)
- 10-50 km minimum separation maintained by autonomous collision avoidance
- But: propellant is finite, control systems degrade, software requires updates

**Key Questions for Modeling:**
- What is the cascade timescale for our specific swarm density and element count?
- How does partial control system failure (e.g., 1% of elements losing station-keeping per year) accelerate cascade onset?
- What is the minimum maintenance cadence to prevent cascade initiation?
- Does the ring/shell architecture (which Lacki finds superior) align with our phased-array power transmission requirements?

## Research Directions

1. **N-body cascade simulation**: Adapt Lacki's analytical framework to Project Dyson's specific swarm parameters (element count, mass, spacing, orbital distribution). Run Monte Carlo simulations of cascade propagation under various partial-failure scenarios.

2. **Maintenance threshold analysis**: Determine the minimum fraction of elements that must maintain active station-keeping to prevent cascade onset. This defines the "maintenance floor" below which the swarm self-destructs.

3. **Debris evolution modeling**: Model the long-term debris environment generated by micrometeorite impacts, element end-of-life events, and rare collisions. Determine whether debris accumulation itself triggers cascade onset within operational timescales.

4. **Institutional maintenance requirements**: Connect cascade timescales to the governance question (rq-0-29) by quantifying what "active maintenance" means in terms of manufacturing capacity, repair fleet size, and organizational continuity.

5. **Architecture optimization for longevity**: Evaluate whether Lacki's ring-based architecture is compatible with phased-array power transmission, and whether orbital geometry choices can extend cascade timescales by orders of magnitude while maintaining energy collection efficiency.
