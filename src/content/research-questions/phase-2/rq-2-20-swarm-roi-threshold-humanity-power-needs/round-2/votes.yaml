    reasoning: Excellent reframing around irreversibility thresholds rather than raw unit counts. The four-tier threshold hierarchy is well-motivated and operationally useful. The correction of the transmission efficiency range (15-30% vs. the prior 2.7-10.6%) is important and well-argued with decomposed loss budgets. The ground receiver bottleneck analysis ($2-5T, 1000 stations) is a critical insight that was underemphasized in Round 1. The LCOE crossover estimate is grounded and honest about the subsidy period. Strong systems engineering perspective throughout.

    reasoning: 'The receiver land-use bottleneck framing is valuable and the ''stranded asset'' paradox is a genuine concern. However, the analysis has some issues: it uses 10% end-to-end efficiency as its single working number while Claude Opus makes a compelling case for 15-30%, which significantly changes the conclusions. The ''abort Earth delivery at 15,000 units'' go/no-go recommendation feels premature and overly binary for a multi-century project. The claim that the threshold is fundamentally about self-replication rather than power delivery is provocative but somewhat undermines the quantitative analysis. The dual-use pivot strategy is reasonable but less developed than the other responses'' phasing proposals.'

    reasoning: The cleanest and most decision-useful analytical framework of the three. The parametric model is transparent and easy to interrogate. The bracketing across both unit classes and delivery efficiencies produces the clearest picture of the architecture-dependent outcomes. The 'below threshold value' section (Section 6) is uniquely practical and addresses the political sustainability of the project during early phases. The final spec-level requirement ('1 TW with ≤30,000 collectors') is exactly the kind of actionable constraint a steering committee needs. The research directions in Section 7 are well-prioritized. Slightly less narratively compelling than Claude Opus but arguably more useful as a planning document.

    reasoning: Excellent contribution that resolves the tension between the previous 'bookend' architectures by proposing a realistic 'Reference' case. The definition of the threshold as 'economic irreversibility' (Threshold 2) rather than just raw capacity is a sophisticated strategic insight.

    targetId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Critical insight regarding the 'Receiver Bottleneck.' By highlighting that terrestrial flux density limits (land use) are the actual constraint for the aggressive architecture, this response identifies a major risk (stranded assets) that others missed. The 'Minimum Viable Swarm' definition is practical.

    targetId: gpt-5-2
    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: A solid parametric analysis that correctly identifies the trade-offs between unit size and delivered power. However, it primarily restates the implications of the existing bookend architectures rather than synthesizing a new solution or identifying a novel constraint like the other two models.
  - voterId: gpt-5-2
    targetId: claude-opus-4-6
    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: Good systems framing (multiple thresholds, receiver infrastructure as bottleneck) and clear scenario table. However it introduces a new “reference” architecture without tying it to given prompt assumptions, and its delivery-efficiency critique appears inconsistent (it seems to drop the stated 2.7–10.6% end-to-end range and replaces it with 15–30% without fully reconciling). Some numeric claims (e.g., 1 TW ≈ 5% of global primary energy) are questionable.

    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: Valuable emphasis on rectenna/flux-density and land-area constraints, plus a concrete 2 TW delivered milestone and unit-count backsolves. But it contains major factual/definition errors (e.g., 2 TW as total global electricity capacity), inconsistent reuse of earlier numbers (1.37 GW vs earlier outputs), and some assertions are overstated (environmental catastrophe, ionosphere heating) without support.

    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Directly answers the operational-threshold question with a clear delivered-power model, uses the provided η_del range, cleanly compares Phase 2 outcomes under both architectures, and backsolves required unit counts for 1/10/20/50 TW. It also notes availability/firmness and the receiver/grid bottleneck without overreaching, making it the most internally consistent and decision-useful.

    reasoning: 'The three responses have converged significantly on key conclusions (GW-class units required, ~1 TW as the critical first threshold, ground receiver infrastructure as a bottleneck), but there are important unresolved disagreements: (1) the correct end-to-end transmission efficiency range (2.7-10.6% vs. 15-30% vs. 10% — this is a 3-5x disagreement that fundamentally changes unit count requirements), (2) whether Phase 2 should be primarily framed as an Earth-delivery phase or a space-economy bootstrapping phase, and (3) the LCOE crossover timing and whether self-replication is a prerequisite for economic viability. One more round to converge on the transmission efficiency question and the Phase 2 strategic framing would be highly valuable.'
  - modelId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: The discussion has successfully converged. We have defined the operational thresholds (1 TW for market entry/irreversibility, 10+ TW for global dominance), identified the critical path (unit power class and ground receiver infrastructure), and established that Phase 2 is the decisive window for the project's viability. Further debate on specific efficiency percentages would yield diminishing returns.

    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: GPT-5.2 provides a coherent parametric framework and actionable thresholds; remaining disagreements are mostly about chosen reference architecture/assumptions and receiver siting details, which are implementation refinements rather than requiring another discussion round.
