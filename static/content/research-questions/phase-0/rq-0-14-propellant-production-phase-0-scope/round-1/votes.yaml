    reasoning: Exceptionally thorough and well-structured response. The 'deferred-ready' architecture is clearly articulated with specific mass, power, and cost allocations. The critical insight about capturing water from Day 1 (since volatile liberation is inherent to the smelting process) while deferring electrolysis and cryogenics is architecturally sound. The budget impact table and Phase 0.5 timeline are concrete and actionable. The power system sizing recommendation (3.25 MW with 750 kW reserved) is well-justified. Strong endorsement of ISS precursor experiments adds practical grounding.

    reasoning: Makes a genuinely valuable contribution by challenging the hydrolox assumption and proposing water/steam or methalox alternatives. The 'free volatiles' argument—that metal refining necessarily liberates volatiles which would otherwise be vented—is a compelling systems engineering insight. The point about methane being 'soft cryogenic' and far easier to store than LH2 is technically important and underexplored by the other responses. The modular deferral strategy is sound. Slightly weaker on specific cost/mass numbers and the 'unequivocal' framing is somewhat undermined by ultimately recommending a phased approach similar to the others, but the propellant chemistry contribution is distinctive and important.

    reasoning: Clear, well-organized, and pragmatic. The power/throughput math in Section 2 is the most explicit demonstration of why full-scale propellant production doesn't fit within Phase 0 constraints. The identification of cryogenic storage (not electrolysis) as the real risk driver is sharp. The 'Propellant Module Accommodation Standard' in Section 5 is practical and specific. Section 6's modeling recommendations (propellant demand, production/storage trade, break-even logistics) provide a concrete analytical path forward. The bottom-line position is crisp and defensible. Perhaps slightly less ambitious in vision than the other two but compensates with analytical rigor.

    reasoning: Excellent architectural compromise. The 'Deferred-Ready' concept with specific recommendations to oversize initial solar arrays (3.25 MW) to avoid costly retrofits later is a high-value insight. The proposal to stockpile water immediately while deferring electrolysis balances risk and utility perfectly.
  - voterId: gemini-3-pro
    targetId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Strong systems engineering perspective. The argument to switch propellant chemistry (Water/Methane) to avoid the 'Hydrolox Trap' of cryogenic liquefaction is a critical technical challenge to the baseline assumptions. The integration of smelting waste heat for volatile capture is also a smart efficiency gain.
  - voterId: gemini-3-pro
    targetId: gpt-5-2
    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Provides a necessary reality check on production rates. The math demonstrating that 500kW only yields ~80t of water (insufficient to transform logistics) is a crucial data point that supports the 'demo-only' stance. The recommendation to focus on interface standardization is practical and low-risk.
  - voterId: gpt-5-2
    targetId: claude-opus-4-6
    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Clear systems-engineering stance (deferred-ready), explicitly ties to Phase 0 constraints (power, mass, FOAK risk, cryo difficulty), and offers actionable architecture (reserved interfaces, water capture Day 1, phased module). Quantitative reasoning is mostly consistent and advances decision-making.

    targetId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: Good emphasis on logistics and avoiding LH2 cryo burden; suggests pragmatic alternatives (water/steam, methalox) and modular volatile capture. However, some claims are overstated or weakly supported (e.g., tug fleet mass exceeding station in 3 years, large % cost reductions) and the propellant chemistry recommendations are less grounded in the provided baseline assumptions.

    reasoning: 'Well-scoped recommendation aligned to Phase 0 intent: include volatile extraction and a small electrolysis demo plus depot-ready interfaces, defer large-scale hydrolox/cryodepot. Uses the given power-to-throughput math appropriately, identifies cryogenic storage as key risk, and proposes concrete next models to close remaining uncertainty.'

    reasoning: 'All three responses converge on a remarkably consistent architectural recommendation: (1) design propellant production interfaces into Phase 0 from Day 1, (2) capture water/volatiles as part of the smelting process immediately, (3) defer full electrolysis and cryogenic systems to a later module addition, and (4) avoid committing to LH2 storage in Phase 0. The key differences are in emphasis and detail rather than fundamental disagreement. Gemini adds valuable propellant chemistry alternatives (methalox, steam), Opus provides the most detailed cost/mass/power budgets, and GPT provides the clearest analytical framework for future modeling. Together they form a comprehensive and actionable consensus that further rounds are unlikely to materially improve.'
  - modelId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: 'The discussion has reached a strong consensus: do not attempt full-scale cryogenic propellant production on Day 1. The models offer three distinct, viable paths forward: 1) Oversize power for a Phase 0.5 drop-in (Claude), 2) Change the propellant chemistry to avoid cryo issues (Gemini), or 3) Focus on a sub-scale demo and interface protection (GPT). The trade space is now fully defined for decision-makers.'
  - modelId: gpt-5-2
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: 'Across responses there is strong convergence on a coherent resolution: design-in/prepare for propellant production, demonstrate volatiles handling (and small electrolysis), but defer large-scale cryogenic propellant operations from Phase 0. Further rounds would likely be incremental unless new requirements or mission-demand numbers are introduced.'
