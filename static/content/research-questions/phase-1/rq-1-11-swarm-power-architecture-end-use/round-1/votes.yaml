    reasoning: 'Exceptionally thorough and well-structured response. Provides the most detailed phased architecture with specific technical parameters (power port specs, voltage upgrade paths, power negotiation protocols). The efficiency chain analysis is rigorous, the Mercury bootstrapping rationale is compelling, and the Phase 1 demonstration recommendation is practical and well-justified. The treatment of the 0.3 AU vs 1.0 AU orbital question as a temporal/phased decision rather than a binary choice is insightful. Minor concern: some specifications (e.g., 0.5m optical aperture) feel premature given the early stage, but the overall framework is excellent.'

    reasoning: Strong systems engineering perspective with several unique and valuable contributions. The 'Wild DC' bus concept for transmission loads is a genuinely creative insight that could dramatically reduce power electronics mass. The microwave phased array argument—using the entire membrane as an electronically steered antenna to solve the pointing problem without mechanical steering—is a compelling technical contribution that the other responses don't fully explore. The 'dumb collector / smart relay' framing is clean and actionable. Slightly less detailed than Claude's response on interface specifications and phasing criteria, but the core technical arguments are sound and complementary.

    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Well-organized and pragmatic response that adds important framing around decision gates and program management. The three-mode power sink taxonomy (local DC, short-range beaming, long-range beaming) is clean and useful for consensus building. The emphasis on working backward from spot size requirements for pointing analysis is methodologically sound. The 'bootstrapping threshold' concept as a measurable decision gate is a valuable programmatic contribution. Slightly less technically deep than the other two on specific subsystem trades, but the interfaces-first philosophy and the explicit treatment of receiver infrastructure as a first-class critical path are important contributions.

    reasoning: This response provides the most comprehensive and actionable roadmap. It successfully reframes the debate from a binary choice to a temporal evolution (Phased Hybrid Approach). The specific technical details regarding the efficiency chain, the thermal penalty of laser conversion at 0.3 AU, and the proposal for a 'Standardized Power Port' are excellent. It directly addresses the previous conflicts about orbit selection by assigning them to different phases.

    reasoning: Gemini offers a very strong counter-proposal that complements Claude's. The 'Direct-to-Earth Fallacy' section is critical reality-checking regarding pointing stability on gossamer structures. The proposal for a 'Wild DC' bus to save mass on power electronics is a specific, high-value engineering trade-off that needs to be captured. The suggestion of microwave phased arrays embedded in the structure is a distinct and valuable alternative to the laser consensus.

    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: While the advice is sound and aligns with the other two (favoring local use/bootstrapping), it is less specific in its technical recommendations. It echoes the 'modular payload' idea but lacks the depth of Claude's interface definitions or Gemini's specific bus architecture ('Wild DC') and microwave proposals. It is a good summary but adds less unique value than the other two.

    reasoning: Strong systems-level framing with a phased architecture that avoids premature hard commitments; gives quantitative efficiency/thermal/pointing arguments, proposes concrete phases (local, inter-unit, Mercury, relays), and identifies interface standards/protocols to lock in now. Minor quibbles (some numeric assumptions and radiator scaling claims could use tighter derivation), but overall highly constructive.

    reasoning: Good high-level conclusion (reject early direct-to-Earth beaming; use relays; bootstrapping focus) and useful idea of minimizing heavy regulation via a 'wild DC' path. However, it contains some shaky/contradictory specifics (e.g., advocating microwave from the swarm while also noting diffraction/rectenna scaling; nanoradian claim is likely overstated; relay orbit suggestions are under-justified), and is less rigorous on interfaces and quantitative tradeoffs.

    reasoning: Well-reasoned, program-aware hybrid proposal emphasizing bootstrapping, modularity, and interface-first design; clearly identifies receiver infrastructure as critical path, ties decisions to measurable gates, and proposes sensible demo objectives. Less detailed than Claude on concrete port specs, but strong on architecture clarity and decision framing.

    reasoning: 'All three responses converge strongly on the same fundamental architecture: phased hybrid with local use first, relay topology for Earth delivery, and standardized interfaces defined early. The key technical disagreements (microwave vs laser for swarm-to-relay, Wild DC vs regulated bus) are well-articulated trade spaces rather than unresolved conflicts. The collective output provides a comprehensive, actionable framework with specific interface specs, phasing criteria, and research directions. Further rounds would likely yield diminishing returns—the consensus is clear and the remaining trades are properly scoped for detailed engineering studies.'
  - modelId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: There is a strong consensus among the models that the initial architecture must be a 'Phased Hybrid' approach focusing on local bootstrapping and short-range transfer rather than direct-to-Earth beaming. The key technical decisions (standardized power interface, dual-mode/wild DC bus, and relay topology) have been identified with sufficient clarity to move to the drafting of the final consensus document. Further debate on specific wavelengths or voltages can be handled in the specific trade studies identified.
  - modelId: gpt-5-2
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: 'Across responses there is convergence on a phased hybrid approach: local/industrial use first, defer Earth delivery, and keep beaming modular with relay options and standardized interfaces. Remaining disagreements are mostly parameterization (microwave vs laser, voltages, pointing) that can proceed as targeted trade studies rather than requiring another general discussion round.'
