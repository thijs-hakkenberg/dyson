    reasoning: 'Exceptional response. The quantitative grounding (27-500 maintenance events/day, drone idle time cost analysis) makes the case for broad autonomy compelling rather than aspirational. The five-tier framework is well-differentiated, with the Tier 2 depot-as-governance-mechanism insight being particularly valuable. The graduated authority expansion protocol with specific statistical thresholds (1,000 operations, <0.5% anomaly rate) is implementable. The argument that swap-first is also governance-simple (ORU swap = Tier 1, weld = Tier 3) is a powerful framing. The self-diagnosis clause for malfunctioning drones and the regression triggers are essential safety features others underemphasize. Minor quibble: five tiers vs four is debatable, but the Tier 0 distinction for continuous housekeeping operations is justified.'

    reasoning: Strong response with several distinctive contributions. The Safety Critical Watchdog (SCW) hardware interlock concept is the most important unique contribution across all three responses—decoupling safety from AI complexity via a simple hardware veto is exactly the kind of defense-in-depth needed. The Digital Twin pre-execution simulation at depots is a concrete and valuable mechanism for depot authority. The four-tier structure is clean and well-reasoned. Slightly less quantitatively grounded than Claude's response, and the Tier 4 'direct human teleoperation' for tumbling satellite recovery may be impractical given latency, but overall a strong contribution that advances the discussion with unique architectural elements.

    reasoning: Excellent response that may be the most implementation-ready of the three. The key insight of classifying by reversibility × consequence radius rather than repair type is the right abstraction. The 'authority gates' concept with eight specific machine-verifiable preconditions is immediately translatable to software requirements—this is the most actionable specification across all responses. The depot approval token with bounded scope is well-specified. The graduated certification metrics (success rate >0.999, near-miss rate, damage incidence, diagnosis accuracy) provide concrete acceptance criteria. The T4 emergency tier allowing autonomous action for imminent cascade prevention is a critical addition. The 'governance-toxic' framing for premature welding autonomy is apt.

    reasoning: This response offers the most comprehensive quantitative justification for its tiered system. It effectively uses the fleet scale (10 million units) to prove that 95% autonomy is a mathematical necessity, not just a preference. The distinction between 'Depot Notification' (Tier 2) and 'Depot Approval' (Tier 3) is a subtle but critical architectural detail that balances oversight with latency better than the other models. The graduated authority expansion protocol is also highly practical.

    reasoning: 'This response introduces a vital hardware-level safety concept: the ''Safety Critical Watchdog'' (SCW). While Claude focuses on software governance, Gemini correctly identifies that software autonomy requires hardware interlocks to be safe. The ''Digital Twin'' simulation at the depot level is also a strong, specific technical recommendation that adds value. The authority matrix is solid, though slightly less detailed on the ''why'' compared to Claude.'

    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: This response is solid and aligns well with the others, particularly in its 'gate' based approach to authority. However, it overlaps significantly with Claude's tiered system without adding the same level of quantitative depth or the specific hardware insights found in Gemini's response. It is a good summary but doesn't advance the discussion as distinctively as the other two.

    reasoning: Strong, actionable tiered authority framework with clear mapping from risk to approval latency, class-specific limits, escalation/regression logic, and concrete mechanisms (tokens, auditable rules, depot oversight). Quantitative throughput argument usefully motivates why broad autonomy is required.

    reasoning: 'Good risk-tiered matrix that cleanly separates swap vs in-situ repair by governance tier, adds a valuable safety-critical watchdog concept, and sensibly elevates depots to authority proxies with tokening/digital twin checks. Minor weakness: Tier 4 teleoperation framing is less realistic at high latency, but overall advances the discussion.'

    targetId: gpt-5-2
    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: Well-structured bounded-autonomy model with clear tier definitions, explicit machine-verifiable gates, class/capability constraints, depot-mediated approvals, and a pragmatic certification/metrics path for expanding autonomy. Directly addresses latency/scale and the swap-vs-repair debate with implementable policy.

    reasoning: 'All three responses converge strongly on the same fundamental architecture: a 4-5 tier risk-based authority framework with depot-mediated intermediate approval, swap-first as the autonomous default, Earth approval reserved for irreversible/novel operations, and graduated authority expansion based on demonstrated reliability. The responses are complementary rather than contradictory—Claude provides quantitative justification and statistical thresholds, Gemini adds hardware watchdogs and digital twin simulation, GPT contributes authority gates and certification metrics. Together they constitute a comprehensive, implementable framework. Further rounds would likely yield diminishing returns on this specific question.'
  - modelId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: The discussion has reached a very strong consensus. We have a clear 4-5 tier authority framework (Claude/Gemini), a specific mechanism for depot involvement (Gemini's Digital Twin/Claude's Notification vs Approval), and a critical hardware safety layer (Gemini's Watchdog). Further discussion on authority limits would likely yield diminishing returns; the next logical step would be defining the specific technical specifications for the 'Depot' architecture mentioned by all three.
  - modelId: gpt-5-2
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: All three responses converge on a coherent risk-tiered authority scheme with depot-mediated supervision, clear escalation criteria, and class-specific limits; further rounds would likely be incremental refinements rather than resolving major open disagreements.
