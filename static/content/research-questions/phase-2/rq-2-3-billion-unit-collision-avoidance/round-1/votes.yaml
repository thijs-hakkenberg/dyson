    reasoning: 'Excellent systems engineering perspective. The framing challenge (certifying emergent system properties, not subsystems) is the right starting point. The quantitative analysis of separation distance vs. thruster response time is particularly valuable—showing that 10 km is insufficient for ion-thruster-only avoidance is a concrete, actionable finding. The three-layer probabilistic framework is well-structured, the emphasis on the scaling exponent as the single most important unknown is insightful, and the staged pathfinder go/no-go criteria are specific and testable. The governance recommendation (proactive standard development) is pragmatic. Minor weakness: could have addressed debris cascade containment more explicitly as part of the certification scope.'

    reasoning: 'Contains several good ideas—the Simplex Architecture for safety kernel certification, the ''Chaos Monkey'' testing approach, and dynamic separation protocols are all valuable contributions. However, there are notable weaknesses: the High-Density Cluster proposal (500m separation for 10,000 units) is problematic because the physics of interactions at 500m separation don''t straightforwardly validate 50km separation behavior—the dynamics are qualitatively different, not just scaled. The claim that ''50 km closes in seconds during retrograde intersection'' is misleading for co-orbital swarm members (retrograde intersections would be design failures, not nominal operations). The ''synthetic orbital gas'' metaphor is evocative but the statistical thermodynamics analogy is stated more than developed. The response is somewhat less rigorous than the other two in its quantitative reasoning.'

    reasoning: The most comprehensive and operationally mature response. The multi-zone model (nominal spacing / keep-out radius / guard zone) derived from uncertainty budgets is exactly the right engineering approach. The tiered verification architecture with explicit correlation-length validation and conservative extrapolation math is rigorous. Critically, this is the only response that adequately addresses debris cascade containment as integral to collision avoidance certification—shell segmentation, low-fragmentation design, and autonomic clearing are essential. The governance section (behavioral contracts, update/patch governance for 10^9 units) addresses real regulatory concerns. The pathfinder criteria focused on validating extrapolation assumptions rather than just demonstrating functionality shows deep understanding of the certification challenge. The quantitative target derivation (p_sat-yr < 5×10^-12) is clearly stated with its implications.

    reasoning: This is an exceptionally strong response. It correctly identifies the core problem as a 'system of systems' certification issue rather than a component one. The three-layer framework (Unit, Cluster, Swarm) is logical and actionable. The specific focus on the 'scaling exponent' of collision risk is a critical insight that adds depth to the discussion. The quantitative analysis of separation distance vs. ion thruster capability is also very valuable.

    vote: APPROVE
    reasoning: This response offers a distinct and highly practical 'Zero-Trust' perspective. The proposal for a 'Simplex Architecture' (complex AI monitored by a simple, formally verified safety core) is a standard but crucial pattern in safety-critical autonomy that fits this problem perfectly. The 'Ant Farm' high-density pathfinder idea is a creative and scientifically sound way to gather relevant statistical data without launching the full billion units.

    vote: NEUTRAL
    reasoning: This response is solid and covers similar ground to the others (PRA-style targets, safety kernels), but feels slightly less innovative in its specific proposals compared to Claude's scaling laws or Gemini's high-density pathfinder. It is a good summary of best practices but doesn't advance the specific 'billion-unit' discussion as sharply as the other two.

    reasoning: Strong systems framing (system-of-systems, emergent property), clear tiered certification approach (unit/cluster/full-swarm), emphasizes formal verification limits of Monte Carlo, identifies key collective failure modes and correlated faults, and proposes concrete pathfinder go/no-go criteria and governance. Some quantitative bits (e.g., separation/ion-thruster timing) are a bit hand-wavy, but overall it advances the discussion substantially.

    reasoning: 'Good ideas: zero-trust framing, Simplex/safety core, chaos testing, degraded-propulsion considerations, and explicit stressor injection. However, it includes questionable/unsafe concepts ("sacrificial exit"/destructive dispersal) and some shaky orbital reasoning (e.g., retrograde intersection framing in a same-swarm context), plus the high-density 500 m test extrapolation claim is statistically and dynamically nontrivial. Useful but less rigorous.'

    reasoning: 'Well-structured certification proposal: deterministic local invariants + PRA-style probabilistic risk with cascade modeling; defines actionable metrics and thresholds; explains why separation must be tied to uncertainty/latency; provides scalable tiered V&V including correlation-length validation; treats debris/cascade containment and update governance as first-class certification items; and gives concrete pathfinder validation objectives. Overall the most complete and regulator-aligned.'

    reasoning: 'All three responses collectively cover the major dimensions of the certification challenge with substantial depth: formal verification of safety kernels, probabilistic risk assessment frameworks, separation distance analysis, scaling law validation, debris cascade containment, governance, and pathfinder criteria. There is strong convergence on key principles (two-layer controller architecture with certified safety kernel, statistical/PRA-based certification, staged pathfinder validation, formal methods for the safety-critical layer). The remaining disagreements are productive design trade-offs (separation distance, testing methodology) rather than fundamental gaps. Further rounds would likely yield diminishing returns.'
  - modelId: gemini-3-pro
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: The discussion has reached a high level of maturity. We have a clear consensus on the need for probabilistic certification, a layered architecture (simple safety core vs. complex optimization), and specific validation strategies (scaling laws, high-density pathfinders). Further discussion is unlikely to yield significantly better high-level architectural insights without moving into actual detailed design.
  - modelId: gpt-5-2
    vote: CONCLUDE
    reasoning: Across the top responses, the discussion converges on a coherent certification paradigm (safety kernel/invariants + probabilistic risk + scaling validation + pathfinder criteria + governance). Further rounds would likely be incremental refinements rather than resolving major open framing issues.
