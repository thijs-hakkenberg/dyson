# Transport Vehicles - Technical Specifications

*Generated by Gemini 3 Pro*

> **Note:** Full specifications pending generation via Databricks API. Run `node scripts/query-bom-specs.js --item=transport-vehicles --model=gemini-3-pro` to generate.

## 1. Executive Summary

The Transport Vehicle fleet provides the logistics backbone for Phase 0, shuttling extracted materials between mining sites and the processing station. These electric-propulsion cargo tugs are designed for efficient, repeated round-trips in the near-Earth asteroid environment.

### Key Design Approach
- High-efficiency ion propulsion for low operating costs
- Standardized cargo containers for simplified loading
- Autonomous navigation and docking capability
- Optimized for slow but fuel-efficient transfers

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Parameter | Gemini Estimate |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Vehicle Mass (dry) | 2.5-3.0 tonnes |
| Cargo Capacity | 8 tonnes |
| Propulsion | Ion thrusters, 12 km/s total ΔV |
| Power System | 25 kW solar arrays |
| Trip Duration | 60-90 days typical |
| Design Life | 10 years / 20 round trips |

## 3. Key Differentiators

Gemini 3 Pro emphasizes:

1. **Electric Propulsion Focus:** Lower thrust but dramatically reduced propellant costs
2. **Standardized Containers:** Universal cargo modules simplify logistics chain
3. **Autonomous Operations:** Minimal ground intervention required per mission
4. **Fleet Scalability:** Simple design enables rapid production scaling

## 4. Cost Estimate

- Development: $200M
- Production (30 vehicles): $450M at $15M/vehicle
- Operations (10 years): $120M
- **Total Program:** ~$770M

## 5. Risk Assessment

Primary risks identified:
1. Long transit times increase material delivery latency
2. Ion thruster reliability over repeated thermal cycles
3. Autonomous docking precision in varying conditions
4. Solar array degradation in asteroid dust environment
