# Transport Vehicles - Technical Specifications

*Generated by GPT-5.2*

> **Note:** Full specifications pending generation via Databricks API. Run `node scripts/query-bom-specs.js --item=transport-vehicles --model=gpt-5-2` to generate.

## 1. Executive Summary

Transport Vehicles are the material logistics workhorses of Project Dyson, moving extracted asteroid resources from mining sites to the processing station and delivering refined materials to construction sites. These hybrid-propulsion cargo vessels balance efficiency with operational flexibility.

### Key Design Philosophy
- Hybrid propulsion for mission flexibility
- Higher cargo capacity per vehicle
- Robust navigation and collision avoidance
- Crewed capability for high-value cargo

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Parameter | GPT Estimate |
|-----------|--------------|
| Vehicle Mass (dry) | 5.5-6.5 tonnes |
| Cargo Capacity | 18 tonnes |
| Propulsion | Hybrid (chemical + ion), 8 km/s ΔV |
| Power System | 40 kW solar arrays |
| Trip Duration | 30-45 days typical |
| Design Life | 12 years / 30 round trips |

## 3. Key Differentiators

GPT-5.2 emphasizes:

1. **Hybrid Propulsion:** Chemical burns enable faster transits when time-critical
2. **Higher Capacity:** Larger cargo loads reduce number of required trips
3. **Crewed Option:** Pressurized module available for personnel transfer missions
4. **Active Navigation:** Radar and lidar for debris avoidance in cluttered environments

## 4. Cost Estimate

- Development: $320M
- Production (20 vehicles): $600M at $30M/vehicle
- Operations (12 years): $200M
- **Total Program:** ~$1.12B

## 5. Risk Assessment

Primary risks identified:
1. Hybrid system complexity increases maintenance requirements
2. Larger vehicles require heavier launch infrastructure
3. Chemical propellant resupply logistics
4. Crewed missions require additional safety certifications
