# Solar Power Arrays - Technical Specifications

*Generated by GPT-5.2*

> **Note:** Full specifications pending generation via Databricks API. Run `node scripts/query-bom-specs.js --item=solar-power-arrays --model=gpt-5-2` to generate.

## 1. Executive Summary

Solar Power Arrays form the energy backbone of Project Dyson's Phase 0 infrastructure, delivering reliable electrical power to all orbital assets. These high-efficiency multi-junction photovoltaic systems prioritize proven technology and long-term reliability over mass optimization.

### Key Design Philosophy
- Multi-junction cells for maximum efficiency
- Rigid panel construction for durability
- Centralized power management and distribution
- Integrated energy storage for eclipse operations

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Parameter | GPT Estimate |
|-----------|--------------|
| Array Size | 1,800 m² total |
| Power Output | 650 kW at 1 AU |
| Specific Power | 120 W/kg |
| Cell Efficiency | 38% (multi-junction) |
| Design Life | 15 years |
| Degradation Rate | 0.8%/year |

## 3. Key Differentiators

GPT-5.2 emphasizes:

1. **Multi-Junction Cells:** Higher efficiency reduces required array area
2. **Rigid Panel Design:** Proven durability against micrometeorites and thermal stress
3. **Integrated Storage:** Battery systems provide continuous power through eclipse periods
4. **Centralized Management:** Unified power distribution optimizes load balancing

## 4. Cost Estimate

- Development: $220M
- Array Production: $480M
- Launch & Deployment: $180M
- Operations (15 years): $95M
- **Total Program:** ~$975M

## 5. Risk Assessment

Primary risks identified:
1. Higher mass increases launch costs substantially
2. Multi-junction cell supply chain constraints
3. Rigid panels require more complex deployment mechanisms
4. Centralized architecture creates potential single points of failure
