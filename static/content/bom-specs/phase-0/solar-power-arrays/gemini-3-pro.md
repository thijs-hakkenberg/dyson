# Solar Power Arrays - Technical Specifications

*Generated by Gemini 3 Pro*

> **Note:** Full specifications pending generation via Databricks API. Run `node scripts/query-bom-specs.js --item=solar-power-arrays --model=gemini-3-pro` to generate.

## 1. Executive Summary

The Solar Power Arrays provide the primary energy infrastructure for all Phase 0 operations, powering mining robots, processing stations, and communication systems. These deployable photovoltaic systems are designed for rapid installation and high reliability in the harsh space environment.

### Key Design Approach
- Thin-film photovoltaics for minimal mass per watt
- Roll-out deployment mechanism for compact stowage
- Distributed array architecture for fault tolerance
- Designed for in-space manufacturing scalability

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Parameter | Gemini Estimate |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Array Size | 2,500 m² total |
| Power Output | 500 kW at 1 AU |
| Specific Power | 200 W/kg |
| Cell Efficiency | 32% (thin-film) |
| Design Life | 12 years |
| Degradation Rate | 1.5%/year |

## 3. Key Differentiators

Gemini 3 Pro emphasizes:

1. **Thin-Film Technology:** Dramatically reduced mass enables more power per launch
2. **Roll-Out Deployment:** Simple mechanical deployment reduces failure modes
3. **Distributed Architecture:** Multiple smaller arrays avoid single-point failures
4. **ISRU-Ready Design:** Architecture supports future in-space manufacturing of additional arrays

## 4. Cost Estimate

- Development: $180M
- Array Production: $300M
- Launch & Deployment: $100M
- Operations (12 years): $60M
- **Total Program:** ~$640M

## 5. Risk Assessment

Primary risks identified:
1. Thin-film durability in micrometeorite environment
2. Lower efficiency requires larger array area
3. Roll-out mechanism reliability in thermal cycling
4. Power transmission losses over distributed architecture
