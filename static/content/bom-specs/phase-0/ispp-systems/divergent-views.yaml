      - statement: "Molten Regolith Electrolysis (MRE) at 1600–1700°C as the baseline, producing oxygen from any anhydrous regolith with metal byproducts, and treats water ice as a supplementary bonus pathway"

          - "Claude"
      - statement: "high-temperature processing entirely in favor of low-temperature (200–400°C) thermal extraction of water via a \"Thermal Worm\" auger, arguing simplicity and fewer failure modes"
        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "a middle position with vacuum thermal desorption at 400–700 K focused on water-bearing regolith but does not propose anhydrous oxygen extraction at all"

      - statement: "for water itself as the sole propellant currency, used directly in steam thermal thrusters (Isp ~190s) and water-plasma Hall thrusters (Isp ~1,500s), explicitly rejecting cryogenic chemical propulsion complexity"
        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "a dual-track LOX/LH₂ primary with LOX/CH₄ secondary, and pragmatically suggests deferring LH₂ liquefaction by initially storing hydrogen as high-pressure gas"
