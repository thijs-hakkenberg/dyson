# Mining Robots - Technical Specifications

*Generated by Gemini 3 Pro*

> **Note:** Full specifications pending generation via Databricks API. Run `node scripts/query-bom-specs.js --item=mining-robots --model=gemini-3-pro` to generate.

## 1. Executive Summary

The Mining Robot fleet forms the primary extraction capability for Phase 0 asteroid operations. These autonomous units will perform surface and sub-surface material extraction on characterized asteroids, operating in swarms to maximize throughput while minimizing single-point failures.

### Key Design Approach
- Modular swarm architecture with interchangeable tool heads
- Emphasis on autonomous coordination without constant Earth oversight
- Lightweight construction optimized for microgravity operations
- Regenerative power systems leveraging waste heat

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Parameter | Gemini Estimate |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Unit Mass | 180-220 kg |
| Power Consumption | 800 W nominal |
| Operational Life | 5 years |
| Extraction Rate | 50 kg/hour regolith |
| Mobility | 6-legged walking + anchoring |
| Communication | Mesh network, 10 Mbps |

## 3. Key Differentiators

Gemini 3 Pro emphasizes:

1. **Swarm Intelligence:** Distributed decision-making reduces latency and single-point failures
2. **Modular Tool System:** Quick-swap end effectors for drilling, scooping, and crushing operations
3. **Lightweight Design:** Lower mass enables more units per launch, increasing redundancy
4. **Self-Repair Capability:** Units can cannibalize damaged peers for spare parts

## 4. Cost Estimate

- Development: $120M
- Production (200 units): $400M at $2.0M/unit
- Operations (5 years): $80M
- **Total Program:** ~$600M

## 5. Risk Assessment

Primary risks identified:
1. Dust contamination in microgravity environment
2. Swarm coordination complexity at scale
3. Tool wear rates on unknown asteroid compositions
4. Power management during eclipse periods
