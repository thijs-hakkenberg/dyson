# Mining Robots - Consensus Analysis

This document synthesizes specifications from Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, and GPT-5.2 to identify areas of agreement, divergence, and open questions.

## Key Specifications

All models agree on these fundamental specifications:

- Fleet of 20 robots is appropriate for initial mining operations
- Mass per robot: 2,500-3,500 kg including tooling
- Multi-leg mobility (hexapod or similar) for asteroid surface traversal
- Autonomous operation capability for months without ground intervention
- On-board material processing for initial concentration
- 5-year minimum operational lifetime
- Solar-powered with battery backup for shadow operations
- Extraction rate target: 1,000+ tonnes per robot per year

## Divergent Views

Models have different perspectives on these aspects:

- **Mobility Architecture**: Claude strongly favors hexapod design, Gemini prefers wheeled rovers for simplicity, GPT suggests hybrid wheel-leg systems.
- **Anchoring System**: Significant divergence on microspines vs. harpoon-tethers vs. gecko-inspired adhesives. Each model prioritizes different approach.
- **Processing Capability**: Claude and Gemini include magnetic/electrostatic separation on-robot, GPT prefers minimal processing with bulk transport.
- **Communication**: Gemini emphasizes inter-robot mesh networks, Claude focuses on relay orbiter, GPT suggests hybrid approach.
- **Cost Per Unit**: Estimates range from $40M to $65M due to different technology assumptions.

## Open Questions

Critical decisions and research needs identified across all models:

- How does regolith behave during excavation in microgravity?
- What anchoring technology is most reliable across asteroid types (C, S, M)?
- What is the optimal fleet composition: homogeneous vs. specialized robots?
- How to handle electrostatic charging effects on mechanisms?
- What level of on-board processing is cost-effective vs. bulk transport?

## Recommended Approach

Based on multi-model analysis, the recommended approach is:

1. **Prioritize anchoring technology R&D** through parabolic flight and ISS testing
2. **Design modular tool system** that can adapt to different asteroid compositions
3. **Start with conservative hexapod design** with backup wheeled option
4. **Minimize on-robot processing** initially; add capability based on operational experience
5. **Deploy small pathfinder fleet (2-3 robots)** before committing to full production
6. **Plan for cooperative operations** even if initial robots work independently

The total budget of $1B for 20 units ($50M/unit) aligns with consensus estimates but requires careful development cost management. Development alone may consume $300-400M.
