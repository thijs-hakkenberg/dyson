# Mining Robots - Technical Specifications

*Generated by GPT-5.2*

> **Note:** Full specifications pending generation via Databricks API. Run `node scripts/query-bom-specs.js --item=mining-robots --model=gpt-5-2` to generate.

## 1. Executive Summary

Mining Robots are the workhorse extraction systems for Project Dyson's asteroid mining operations. These robust, semi-autonomous units combine advanced sensing with powerful extraction tools to efficiently harvest valuable materials from asteroid surfaces and shallow sub-surface deposits.

### Key Design Philosophy
- Heavy-duty construction for extended operational life
- Hybrid autonomy with ground-operator intervention capability
- Integrated material analysis for real-time grade assessment
- Redundant systems for mission-critical reliability

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Parameter | GPT Estimate |
|-----------|--------------|
| Unit Mass | 280-320 kg |
| Power Consumption | 1.2 kW nominal |
| Operational Life | 7 years |
| Extraction Rate | 75 kg/hour regolith |
| Mobility | Tracked + anchor spikes |
| Communication | Direct-to-Earth + relay, 50 Mbps |

## 3. Key Differentiators

GPT-5.2 emphasizes:

1. **Robust Construction:** Heavier build ensures longer operational life and higher extraction forces
2. **Integrated Analysis:** On-board XRF and mass spectrometry for real-time ore grading
3. **Tracked Mobility:** Superior traction and stability on varied terrain
4. **Operator Override:** Full teleoperation capability for complex situations

## 4. Cost Estimate

- Development: $180M
- Production (150 units): $525M at $3.5M/unit
- Operations (7 years): $140M
- **Total Program:** ~$845M

## 5. Risk Assessment

Primary risks identified:
1. Higher unit mass increases launch costs significantly
2. Track system vulnerability to fine regolith infiltration
3. Communication latency limits real-time operator intervention
4. Integrated sensors increase unit complexity and failure modes
