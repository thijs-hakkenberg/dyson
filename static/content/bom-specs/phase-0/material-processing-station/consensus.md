# Material Processing Station - Consensus Analysis

This document synthesizes specifications from Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, and GPT-5.2 to identify areas of agreement, divergence, and open questions.

## Key Specifications

All models agree on these fundamental specifications:

- Single station with modular, expandable architecture
- Initial mass: 400,000-500,000 kg; full build: 800,000-1,000,000 kg
- Processing throughput: 50,000 tonnes/year at full capacity
- Located at Sun-Earth L4/L5 or similar stable orbit
- 30-year design life with periodic module replacement
- Solar-powered with 1-2.5 MW capacity
- Primarily autonomous with periodic crew visits
- Capable of producing structural metals (Al, Fe, Ni) and solar-grade silicon

## Divergent Views

Models have different perspectives on these aspects:

- **Crew Presence**: Claude and GPT recommend human-tended with quarterly visits; Gemini favors fully autonomous with annual visits only.
- **Silicon Processing**: Claude includes dedicated silicon refining module; Gemini questions whether solar-grade silicon is achievable in early phases.
- **Smelting Technology**: Solar concentrator furnaces (Claude) vs. electric arc furnaces (GPT) vs. hybrid approach (Gemini).
- **Location**: Consensus on L4/L5 but disagreement on whether to co-locate with asteroid or optimize for Earth access.
- **Cost Estimates**: Range from $8B to $15B for initial station, reflecting different scope assumptions.

## Open Questions

Critical decisions and research needs identified across all models:

- Can microgravity metallurgy scale from lab experiments to industrial production?
- What is the optimal process for zone refining in zero-g?
- How to manage and recycle slag in microgravity?
- Should propellant production be included in Phase 0 scope?
- What level of silicon purity is achievable, and is it sufficient for solar cells?

## Recommended Approach

Based on multi-model analysis, the recommended approach is:

1. **Conduct ISS metallurgy experiments** before committing to station design
2. **Plan for modular growth** starting with minimum viable processing capability
3. **Prioritize metal refining** over silicon processing initially
4. **Include crew habitat** for periodic maintenance and upgrades
5. **Use hybrid solar/electric smelting** for flexibility
6. **Site at L4/L5** for stability and reasonable communication latency

The total budget of $10B is at the lower end of estimates and assumes successful technology development. Include 30-40% contingency for this high-risk element.
