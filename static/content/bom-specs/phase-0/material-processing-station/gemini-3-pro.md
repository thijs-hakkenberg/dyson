# Material Processing Station - Technical Specifications

*Generated by Gemini 3 Pro*

> **Note:** Full specifications pending generation via Databricks API. Run `node scripts/query-bom-specs.js --item=material-processing-station --model=gemini-3-pro` to generate.

## 1. Executive Summary

The Material Processing Station serves as the central refinery hub for Phase 0 operations, converting raw asteroid regolith into usable feedstocks. This orbital facility will perform initial separation, sorting, and refinement of extracted materials for use in subsequent construction phases.

### Key Design Approach
- Compact modular architecture for incremental deployment
- Gravity-free processing techniques optimized for space
- Closed-loop resource utilization minimizing waste
- Scalable design supporting future capacity expansion

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Parameter | Gemini Estimate |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Station Mass | 45-55 tonnes |
| Processing Capacity | 500 kg/day |
| Power Requirement | 150 kW |
| Crew Capacity | Uncrewed (autonomous) |
| Design Life | 15 years |
| Output Products | Metals, volatiles, slag |

## 3. Key Differentiators

Gemini 3 Pro emphasizes:

1. **Fully Autonomous Operation:** No crew required, reducing life support complexity
2. **Modular Growth:** Station expands through additional processing modules
3. **Electrostatic Separation:** Energy-efficient method for microgravity sorting
4. **Minimal Waste:** Slag repurposed for radiation shielding material

## 4. Cost Estimate

- Development: $350M
- Station Construction: $800M
- Launch & Assembly: $200M
- Operations (15 years): $300M
- **Total Program:** ~$1.65B

## 5. Risk Assessment

Primary risks identified:
1. Assembly complexity in microgravity environment
2. Autonomous system reliability over 15-year lifespan
3. Material handling in zero-g presents contamination risks
4. Thermal management during high-power processing cycles
