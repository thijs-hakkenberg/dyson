# Material Processing Station - Technical Specifications

*Generated by GPT-5.2*

> **Note:** Full specifications pending generation via Databricks API. Run `node scripts/query-bom-specs.js --item=material-processing-station --model=gpt-5-2` to generate.

## 1. Executive Summary

The Material Processing Station is Project Dyson's primary in-space refinery, transforming raw asteroid material into refined products essential for construction and fuel production. This crewed orbital facility combines proven terrestrial processing techniques adapted for microgravity with advanced automation.

### Key Design Philosophy
- Human-supervised operations for quality assurance
- Proven processing technologies adapted for space
- High throughput prioritizing production volume
- Integrated storage and distribution capability

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Parameter | GPT Estimate |
|-----------|--------------|
| Station Mass | 85-100 tonnes |
| Processing Capacity | 1,200 kg/day |
| Power Requirement | 280 kW |
| Crew Capacity | 4-6 personnel |
| Design Life | 20 years |
| Output Products | Refined metals, propellants, water, construction feedstock |

## 3. Key Differentiators

GPT-5.2 emphasizes:

1. **Crewed Operations:** Human oversight enables adaptive problem-solving and quality control
2. **Higher Throughput:** Larger facility processes more material per day
3. **Centrifugal Separation:** Artificial gravity zones for traditional processing methods
4. **Integrated Propellant Production:** On-site fuel manufacturing for transport fleet

## 4. Cost Estimate

- Development: $550M
- Station Construction: $1.4B
- Launch & Assembly: $450M
- Operations (20 years): $800M (including crew rotation)
- **Total Program:** ~$3.2B

## 5. Risk Assessment

Primary risks identified:
1. Crew safety and long-duration life support requirements
2. Larger station increases assembly complexity and launch costs
3. Centrifuge systems introduce mechanical failure modes
4. Higher operational costs due to crew support logistics
