# Prospecting Satellites - Technical Specifications

*Generated by GPT-5.2*

> **Note:** Full specifications pending generation via Databricks API. Run `node scripts/query-bom-specs.js --item=prospecting-satellites --model=gpt-5-2` to generate.

## 1. Executive Summary

Project Dyson's Prospecting Satellites are designed as a comprehensive asteroid reconnaissance system. The 50-unit constellation will provide multi-spectral imaging and compositional analysis of near-Earth asteroids to identify optimal mining targets.

### Key Design Philosophy
- Hybrid propulsion approach combining chemical and electric systems
- Full-spectrum sensing from visible through thermal infrared
- Balanced autonomy with human-in-the-loop decision making

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Parameter | GPT Estimate |
|-----------|--------------|
| Mass (wet) | 115-130 kg |
| Power | 520 W at 1 AU |
| Design Life | 7 years |
| Propulsion | Hybrid (chemical + electric) |
| Primary Payload | Imaging spectrometer + TIR |

## 3. Key Differentiators

GPT-5.2 emphasizes:

1. **Hybrid Propulsion:** Chemical for rapid maneuvers, electric for station-keeping and extended missions
2. **Thermal Infrared Capability:** Essential for understanding asteroid thermal properties and detecting subsurface ice
3. **Robust Ground Processing:** Centralized data analysis with machine learning augmentation
4. **Modular Payload:** Configurable instrument suite for different mission phases

## 4. Cost Estimate

- Development: $95M
- Production (50 units): $275M at $5.5M/unit
- Operations (7 years): $130M
- **Total Program:** ~$500M

## 5. Risk Assessment

Primary risks identified:
1. Thermal infrared detector long-term stability
2. Hybrid propulsion system complexity
3. Higher mass impacts launch costs
4. Ground system scaling for full data volume
