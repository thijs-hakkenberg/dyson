# Prospecting Satellites - Technical Specifications

*Generated by Gemini 3 Pro*

> **Note:** Full specifications pending generation via Databricks API. Run `node scripts/query-bom-specs.js --item=prospecting-satellites --model=gemini-3-pro` to generate.

## 1. Executive Summary

The Prospecting Satellite constellation represents the reconnaissance backbone of Phase 0, tasked with systematically cataloging and characterizing near-Earth asteroids for mining suitability. A distributed network of 50 small spacecraft will provide comprehensive spectral mapping of asteroid surfaces.

### Key Design Approach
- Emphasis on inter-satellite mesh networking for resilient data relay
- Electric propulsion for extended mission flexibility
- Compact spectrometer design prioritizing mass efficiency

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Parameter | Gemini Estimate |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Mass (wet) | 95-110 kg |
| Power | 400 W at 1 AU |
| Design Life | 8 years |
| Propulsion | Ion thruster, 3 km/s ΔV |
| Primary Payload | Vis/NIR spectrometer |

## 3. Key Differentiators

Gemini 3 Pro emphasizes:

1. **Mesh Network Architecture:** Strong inter-satellite communication reduces dependence on ground stations
2. **Electric Propulsion:** Higher delta-V enables more flexible targeting
3. **Simplified Thermal Design:** Omitting thermal infrared reduces complexity and cost
4. **Distributed Processing:** On-board spectral analysis shares computational load across constellation

## 4. Cost Estimate

- Development: $75M
- Production (50 units): $225M at $4.5M/unit
- Operations (7 years): $100M
- **Total Program:** ~$400M

## 5. Risk Assessment

Primary risks identified:
1. Electric propulsion reliability over extended mission
2. Mesh network scalability with full constellation
3. Ground processing bottleneck with reduced on-board capability
