        models:
          - "Claude"
      - statement: "designs slugs as \"dumb packets\" with only passive radar reflectors and visual fiducials and no active systems"
        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "a middle position with minimal avionics for bulk slugs (beacon + retroreflector) but full nav and microthrusters for precision/high-value cargoes"

        models:
          - "Claude"
      - statement: "processing into the mining rig itself (the AESR at 4,500 tonnes performs sintering onboard, producing 1 slug every 30 seconds)"
        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "far larger depots at 50,000–500,000 tonnes each, organized into ~10–20 \"mega-port\" complexes rather than distributed stations"

    topic: "Catcher energy recovery"
    positions:
      - statement: "designs the MELN catcher as a regenerative system that recovers captured kinetic energy into supercapacitor banks and feeds it to local foundries or the power grid"
        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "magnetic braking energy as waste heat that must be radiated away (~1 TW thermal dissipation)"
        models:
          - "Claude"
      - statement: "for energy recovery as a critical R&D priority but acknowledges it is low-TRL and may not be achievable at scale"

    topic: "Mass driver recoil management"
    positions:
      - statement: "bidirectional launch scheduling (paired drivers firing in opposite directions) plus dedicated ion-engine station-keeping on the anchor asteroid"
        models:
          - "Claude"
      - statement: "continuous ion thruster banks firing opposite the launch vector plus counter-rotating flywheels for torque management"

    positions:
      - statement: "this as a first-class safety-critical concern, specifying cryptographic multi-party launch authorization, geofenced trajectories with physical coil-timing limits preventing planet-crossing shots, independent audit constellations, and hardware abort logic"
        models:
          - "Gpt"
      - statement: "collision avoidance and dark-slug tracking but does not address weaponization risk"
        models:

    positions:
      - statement: "a 50/50 split (specialty materials from inner system, bulk from local KBOs) with Class C mining ships co-located with foundries consuming individual KBOs over 10–50 years"
        models:
          - "Claude"
      - statement: "not detail outer-system logistics beyond noting Main Belt and Trojans as primary sources"
        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "the outer-system problem as primarily about \"seeding factories + high-value trace shipments\" and poses the crossover radius as an open design question"
