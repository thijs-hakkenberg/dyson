    positions:
      - statement: "OAM as a **baseline multiplexing dimension** (16 OAM modes × 1024 WDM channels per Class A relay, integral to achieving 10 Pbps per link)"
        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "OAM as an **optional link-level enhancement only**, explicitly recommending no OAM dependency in the baseline design due to sensitivity to pointing jitter, optics aberrations, and contamination, and flagging OAM practicality as an open question"

      - statement: "**1"
        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "**many 30–50 cm apertures in parallel** rather than fewer large apertures, arguing this is more manufacturable and maintainable at scale, with segmented/replicated mirrors compensated by coherent DSP and adaptive optics, deferring meter-class optics until manufacturing proves cost-effective"

        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "**10–200 Tbps per node at IOC scaling to 1–10 Pbps at full build** achieved via many parallel terminals and channels rather than single-link heroics, explicitly noting that capacity scales with relay density and terminal count, not individual link performance"

  - id: "adjacent-layer-vs-multi-hop-trunk-topology"
    topic: "Adjacent-Layer vs. Multi-Hop Trunk Topology"
    positions:
      - statement: "advocates **adjacent-layer links only** (Layer n ↔ n+1) as the primary transport, with skip links at ≤1% of trunk count, arguing that beam divergence and pointing complexity make multi-AU single hops impractical for core capacity"

          - "Gpt"
  - id: "cost-estimate-scale"
    topic: "Cost Estimate Scale"
    positions:
      - statement: "a total backbone cost of **~10¹⁵ manufacturing-node-years**, driven primarily by 2×10⁹ Class A relays at $250K each"
        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "**~10¹²–10¹³ equivalent**, with 10⁸–10⁹ relay nodes as the dominant cost driver, representing a **2–3 order of magnitude disagreement** that reflects fundamentally different assumptions about relay count, unit cost, and aperture strategy"

  - id: "security-and-control-plane-emphasis"
    topic: "Security and Control Plane Emphasis"
    positions:
      - statement: "a detailed **security model** (hardware root of trust, post-quantum cryptography, signed routing updates, optical beam authentication, control-plane hardening) and explicit control-plane/data-plane separation on dedicated wavelengths"
        models:
          - "Gpt"
      - statement: "not address security or control-plane architecture, focusing instead on physical-layer and protocol-level design"
        models:
          - "Gemini"
