      - statement: "a **hybrid approach** with manifolded heat pipes and loop heat pipes as the primary lateral transport mechanism, arguing that conduction alone cannot prevent hotspots across kilometer-scale membranes"

        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "recommends treating ≤20 K as **optional/aspirational second-wave capability**, prioritizing 40–80 K cold computing first with only localized deep-cold islands, citing superfluid containment at scale as TRL ~1–2 and a potential dead end"
