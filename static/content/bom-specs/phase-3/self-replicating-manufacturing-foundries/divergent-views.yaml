      - statement: "rejects this as a \"TRL cliff\" blocker and recommends a staged approach — Stage A (import die, package/test in space), Stage B (mature-node 90–28 nm in-space lithography), Stage C (advanced ≤10 nm only after proven closure) — arguing the foundry must replicate robustly *without* requiring nanometer fabs"

        models:
          - "Gemini"
      - statement: "not require this mechanism at baseline because it defers advanced lithography, instead relying on physical separation of dirty and clean modules along the spine with sealed clean cells and electrostatic dust control as sufficient for packaging-level work"

      - statement: "a hybrid approach with very large solar arrays (1–3 GW_e nameplate) plus 200–800 MW_e nuclear fission baseload plus molten salt thermal storage, arguing this reduces dependence on beamed power and provides continuous process stability for energy-intensive refining"

      - statement: "roll-to-roll membrane radiators at ~450–600 K operating temperature, sized at 250,000–600,000 m² per foundry, emphasizing that radiator production should be among the earliest self-manufactured outputs to break the thermal throughput bottleneck"
