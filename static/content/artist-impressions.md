**Hot Tiles (CST-H, 800-1200 K):**
Innermost shell, closest to Sun. Sun-facing surface is a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) harvester - dark, textured surface optimized for absorbing radiation from the Sun. The tile glows visibly at operating temperature (dull red to orange). Wide-bandgap semiconductors (SiC/GaN/diamond) enable computation at extreme temperatures. Anti-sunward face features photonic crystal spectral-selective emitters - visible as iridescent, structured surfaces that emit in narrow infrared bands.

**Mid Tiles (CST-M, 200-400 K):**
The computational workhorse layer. TPV harvesters on the sun-facing side absorb infrared radiation from the Hot shell's emitters. Standard silicon-based compute substrate provides the highest density computation. Modular "Compute Cartridges" bonded to a Thermal Backbone Plane allow technology upgrades. Anti-sunward emitters glow in the far-infrared (invisible to human eyes, but visualized as cool blue for artistic purposes).

**Cold Tiles (CST-C, 40-80 K):**
Outermost passive shell. Extremely low thermal emission enables cryogenic computing (superconducting interconnects, quantum substrates). These tiles appear nearly black, absorbing the last useful energy from the cascade. Minimal thermal signature.

Alkali-metal (sodium/potassium) heat pipes transfer heat from tiles to radiating surfaces. The panels glow orange-red, creating a warm inner shell visible across the solar system.

**Mid Shell Radiators (200-400 K):**
Larger area, lower specific power. Passive spectral vanes emit in narrow infrared bands tuned to the Cold shell's TPV harvesters. Carbon-carbon and pyrolytic graphite thermal spreaders create distinctive layered edge profiles. No visible glow, but infrared cameras would show intricate emission patterns.

**Cold Shell Radiators (40-80 K):**
Ultra-low emissivity except in specific bands. Graphene membranes at 0.05-0.2 kg/m² areal density stretched across vast areas. Active cryogenic cooling required for the coldest regions (≤20 K), featuring multi-stage helium refrigerators visible as compact machinery at radiator edges.

Robots optimized for deploying and maintaining the delicate thermal radiator membranes. Gentle manipulation capability. Membrane tension monitoring.

**ORU Swap Drones:**
Rapid response units for replacing failed tiles and components. Similar to Phase 2 maintenance drones but adapted for Matroska scale. Carry standardized replacement units.

**Key Visual Elements:**
- Diverse robot types working in coordination
- Heavy assembly operations (major infrastructure)
- Delicate membrane handling
- Rapid tile replacement operations
- Swarm coordination patterns
- Robot depot/staging areas

**Environment:** Throughout Matroska shells; concentrated at construction fronts and damage sites

## Verification

After creating artist impressions, verify against:
- Technical specifications in consensus documents
- Scale relationships between elements
- Environmental context (orbital location, solar distance)
- Operational states (deployment, operation, maintenance)
- Thermodynamic consistency (heat flows, glow temperatures)
