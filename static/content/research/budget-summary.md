# Project Dyson Budget Summary

**Generated:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** REVISED - Capacity Cost Model Adopted
**Total Estimated Cost:** ~$9.2 trillion (across all phases)

---

## Executive Summary

Project Dyson's budget has been **fundamentally revised** following multi-model consensus on cost methodology ([rq-0-28](/questions/isru-cost-methodology-validation)). The previous $10.3 quadrillion estimate used linear unit-cost methodology inappropriate for self-replicating ISRU systems. The new **capacity cost model** reduces Phase 2-3 estimates by 10-1,350x.

**Key insight:** Self-replicating, autonomous, in-situ manufacturing has fundamentally different economics than procurement-based space programs. Marginal cost per unit approaches zero once manufacturing infrastructure is operational.

## Capacity Cost Model Framework

### Cost Components

| Component | Description | Scales With |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Seed Investment** | Earth-manufactured foundries, initial robots | Fixed (one-time) |
| **Bootstrap Operations** | Support during ramp-up | Time (years) |
| **Import Streams ("Vitamins")** | Non-ISRU components | Mass fraction × total mass |
| **Oversight & Governance** | Software, coordination, QA | System complexity (log) |
| **Risk Reserves** | Contingency | Percentage of above |

### Key Assumptions

- **Mass closure ratio:** ≥96% for mature foundries
- **Replication cycle:** 12 months per foundry generation
- **Vitamin fraction:** ~4% for structural, higher for electronics
- **Autonomy level:** Minimal human intervention after bootstrap

### Critical Unknowns

1. **Achievable closure ratio:** If 80-90% instead of 96%, costs increase 5-50x
2. **In-situ semiconductor fabrication:** Can rad-hard processors be asteroid-sourced?
3. **Multi-generational replication:** Quality degradation over thousands of generations?
4. **Autonomy maturity:** Actual oversight requirements for trillion-unit swarms?

## Methodology Change Rationale

The previous linear methodology (unit cost × unit count) is appropriate for **procurement-based systems** where every unit is Earth-manufactured and launched. It correctly estimates Phase 0-1 costs.

For Phase 2-3, this methodology produces **phantom numbers** disconnected from actual resource requirements:

- **Raw materials:** Free (asteroid feedstock)
- **Energy:** Free (solar power)
- **Labor:** Free (autonomous robots)
- **Factory capacity:** Self-replicating (exponential growth)

The capacity cost model recognizes that **marginal cost per unit approaches zero** once manufacturing infrastructure is operational. The budget is dominated by:

1. Initial seed investment
2. "Vitamin" imports for non-ISRU components
3. Software and governance systems
