# Project Dyson Budget Summary

**Generated:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** Draft for review
**Total Estimated Cost:** ~$10.3 quadrillion (across all phases)

---

## Executive Summary

Project Dyson's budget spans five construction phases over centuries, from initial asteroid mining infrastructure (~$15.7B) to stellar-scale megastructures (~$10 quadrillion). Cost estimates are derived from multi-model LLM consensus (Claude, Gemini, GPT) using heritage scaling, learning curves, and confidence levels.

**Critical observation:** Current methodology may systematically overestimate costs for later phases by 5-20x due to applying terrestrial production economics to in-situ, autonomous, self-replicating space operations. See [Research Question rq-0-28](/research/questions/phase-0/isru-cost-methodology-validation) for ongoing methodology review.

### Phase 1: Initial Swarm Deployment
**Total Cost:** $158 billion
**Duration:** 20-30 years
**Status:** Planned

| BOM ID | Item | Quantity | Cost | Range | Confidence |
|--------|------|----------|------|-------|------------|
| bom-1-1 | Solar Collector Units | 1,000 units | $100B | $60B - $160B | Low |
| bom-1-2 | PV Blanket Arrays | 5,000 units | $25B | $15B - $40B | Medium |
| bom-1-3 | Assembly Robots | 50 units | $3B | $1.8B - $4.8B | Medium |
| bom-1-4 | Assembly Node Hub | 1 hub | $15B | $9B - $24B | Low |

| bom-1-7 | Swarm Control System | 1 system | $5B | $3B - $8B | Medium |

**Cost basis:** First-of-kind large-scale space manufacturing. High uncertainty due to novel thin-film membrane spacecraft and orbital assembly facilities.

**ISRU Transition Point:** Earth manufacturing for first 1,000-2,000 units; ISRU transition at ~3,500 units. This is the critical inflection point where in-situ production begins reducing per-unit costs.

### Phase 2: Swarm Expansion
**Total Cost:** $5.125 trillion
**Duration:** 50-100 years
**Status:** Planned

| BOM ID | Item | Quantity | Cost | Range | Confidence |
|--------|------|----------|------|-------|------------|
| bom-2-1 | Solar Collector Satellites | 100,000 units | $5T | $2.5T - $8.5T | Low |
| bom-2-2 | Maintenance Drones | 5,000 units | $50B | $25B - $85B | Low |
| bom-2-3 | Manufacturing Expansion | 5 facilities | $75B | $37.5B - $127.5B | Low |

**Cost basis:** Assumes successful ISRU transition and manufacturing learning curves from Phase 1. Unit cost of $50M/satellite assumes significant reduction from Phase 1's $100M through automation and in-situ materials.

**Key assumption:** Learning curve reduces costs as production scales. However, see methodology concerns below.

## Grand Total Summary

**Note:** Phase 3a and 3b may execute in parallel, so total is not strictly additive.

## Current Cost Methodology

### Heritage Scaling
Early phase costs derived from existing space systems:
- ISS modules ($2-3B each)
- Mars rovers ($2-3B per mission)
- Commercial satellites ($100M-500M)
- Launch costs ($2,000-10,000/kg to LEO)

### Learning Curves
Assumes manufacturing cost reductions:
- 85% learning curve for spacecraft production
- Volume discounts for mass production
- Automation reducing labor costs

### Confidence Levels
- **High:** Within 30% of estimate; based on heritage systems
- **Medium:** Within 50% of estimate; extrapolated from heritage
- **Low:** Within 70% of estimate; novel systems, high uncertainty

### ISRU Cost Reductions
Current estimates assume ISRU transition reduces costs by:
- Phase 1-2 transition: 50% unit cost reduction
- Phase 2 ongoing: 10-20% additional learning curve

## Methodology Concerns

### What Current Estimates Include

1. **Launch costs** - Fully accounted for Earth-manufactured components
2. **Raw material costs** - Based on terrestrial commodity prices
3. **Labor costs** - Engineering and manufacturing labor at terrestrial rates
4. **Energy costs** - Power generation and distribution at commercial rates
5. **Facility costs** - Manufacturing facilities at terrestrial construction costs

### What ISRU Operations Eliminate

1. **Launch costs** - Material stays in space once extracted
2. **Raw material costs** - Asteroid resources are free (extraction cost only)
3. **Direct labor costs** - Autonomous systems require no wages
4. **Energy costs** - Solar power is essentially free at 1 AU
5. **Replication costs** - Self-replicating systems amortize over generations

### Potential Overestimation

If the above cost categories represent 80-95% of terrestrial production costs, and ISRU eliminates most of them, then current estimates may overstate Phase 2+ costs by:

- **Conservative case:** 5x overestimate (assume 80% cost elimination, 4x operational complexity overhead)
- **Moderate case:** 10x overestimate (assume 90% cost elimination, 1.1x complexity overhead)
- **Optimistic case:** 20x overestimate (assume 95% cost elimination, economies of scale)

This implies:
- Phase 2 actual cost: $250B - $1T (instead of $5.1T)
- Phase 3a actual cost: $500T - $2Q (instead of $10.2Q)
- Phase 3b actual cost: $5.5T - $22T (instead of $110T)

### Outstanding Questions

1. **When does terrestrial economics stop applying?** At what unit count do in-situ, self-replicating systems dominate?

2. **What is the marginal cost of the Nth unit?** Once infrastructure exists, what does it actually cost to produce additional collectors?

3. **How do we value "free" solar energy?** Standard economics assigns zero marginal cost to sunlight.

4. **What control system overhead exists?** Autonomous systems still require maintenance and oversight.

5. **How do we account for time preference?** A 100-year construction program has different economics than a 10-year program.
