### Microgravity Electrolysis (3 external papers)

Literature review for rq-0-33 identified magnetic phase separation as a breakthrough approach. The August 2025 Nature Chemistry paper by Romero-Calvo et al. demonstrates passive gas-liquid separation using permanent magnets with up to 240% current density improvement. Foundation work from 2022 npj Microgravity papers validates the underlying physics.

### Perovskite Space PV (4 external papers)

Extended review for rq-1-9 adds NREL's SiO₂ radiation barrier discovery (>99% weight reduction vs conventional barriers), polyimide encapsulation validation, and the Georgia Tech MISSE-21 ISS flight test (18 PV cells, data expected mid-2026). SiO₂ + polyimide substrate emerging as baseline architecture.

### Space Semiconductor Fabrication (3 external papers)

Literature for rq-0-44 captures the rapid advance from TRL 2-3 to orbital demonstration. Space Forge's ForgeStar-1 (Dec 2025) and NASA's ODME program (EHD inkjet printing) represent the leading approaches. EHD printing is particularly relevant for ISRU feedstock compatibility.

### Radiation Shielding (6 external papers)

Review for rq-0-35 covers AstroRad flight-proven selective shielding, hybrid active-passive studies (20-40% mass reduction), water as dual-use shielding, and MgB₂ HTS superconducting magnet advances. Combined approaches could reduce shielding estimates from 4-8K kg to 3-5K kg per module.

### Alternative Propellants (4 external papers)

Literature for rq-1-31 is dominated by SpaceX's operational deployment of argon Hall thrusters on Starlink V2 Mini at constellation scale. Comprehensive reviews and IEPC 2025 data provide engineering parameters. Iodine identified as additional near-xenon performance option.

### Power Transmission (4 external papers)

Review for rq-2-23 identified a novel >85% efficiency magnetron design (simulation), JAXA's 0.001-degree retrodirective pointing, and updated rectenna/system efficiency analyses. Theoretical end-to-end chain improved to ~68-73% but no GW-scale demos exist.

### Space Governance (3 external papers)

Contextual developments for rq-0-29 including NIST circular economy governance, von Neumann probe governance gap analysis (Artemis Accords silent on self-replication), and Borgue & Hein self-replication quantitative estimates (~70% achievable near-term).
