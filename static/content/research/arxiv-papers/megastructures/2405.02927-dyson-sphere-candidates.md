# Project Hephaistos II - Dyson Sphere Candidates from Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and WISE

## Abstract

This research examines optical and infrared observations from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE to identify potential Dyson spheres as technosignatures of advanced civilizations. The team processed five million objects using machine learning and filtering techniques, narrowing results to **7 candidates deserving of further analysis**, all centered on M-dwarf stars exhibiting unexplained infrared excess.

## Key Findings

- Processed ~5 million stellar objects from Gaia DR3
- Applied machine learning filtering to identify infrared anomalies
- Identified 7 M-dwarf candidates with unexplained infrared excess
- Candidates consistent with partial Dyson sphere signatures
- Alternative explanations (debris disks, background galaxies) not ruled out

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides observational constraints on what completed or partial Dyson structures might look like from astronomical surveys. Key insights:

1. **Detection signatures**: Infrared excess is the primary detection mechanism for waste heat
2. **M-dwarf preference**: Lower-luminosity stars may be preferred targets for megastructure construction
3. **Partial structures**: Even partial (non-complete) Dyson swarms produce detectable signatures
