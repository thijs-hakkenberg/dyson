# The Fellowship of the Dyson Ring: GTOC 11 Results and Methods

## Abstract

This paper details the ACT&Friends team's approach to GTOC 11, which involved trajectory planning for constructing a precursor Dyson structure—a ring of twelve heliocentric stations. The team developed integrated approaches combining machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and evolutionary techniques.

## Key Methods

1. **Machine-learned transfer time estimator**: Neural network predicting low-thrust transfer durations
2. **Combinatorial optimization**: Assigning spacecraft to station construction tasks
3. **Evolutionary algorithms**: Refining trajectory solutions
4. **Low-thrust optimization**: Optimal phasing for fuel-efficient transfers

## Technical Achievements

- Achieved 2nd place in GTOC 11 competition
- Constructed 12 heliocentric stations forming a Dyson ring precursor
- Optimized multi-spacecraft coordination for construction logistics
- Demonstrated scalable planning for megastructure assembly

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Directly applicable to Phase 1-2 swarm deployment:

1. **Trajectory planning**: Methods for positioning swarm elements
2. **Construction logistics**: Multi-spacecraft coordination approaches
3. **Heliocentric stations**: Precursor architecture similar to our assembly nodes
4. **Scalability**: ML-based planning can scale to larger swarms
