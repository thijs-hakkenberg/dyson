# Project Hephaistos I - Upper Limits on Partial Dyson Spheres in the Milky Way

## Abstract

This study establishes observational constraints on hypothetical megastructures by combining optical data from Gaia DR2 with mid-infrared data from AllWISE to set the strongest upper limits to date on the prevalence of partial Dyson spheres within the Milky Way, based on their expected waste-heat signatures.

## Key Findings

- For stars within 100 parsecs: fewer than ~2×10⁻⁵ could host 300 K Dyson spheres at 90% completion
- Constraints weaken for less complete structures and greater distances
- Established methodology for waste-heat signature detection
- Created pipeline for systematic megastructure searches

## Statistical Constraints

| Distance | Completion | Upper Limit |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| 100 pc | 90% | <2×10⁻⁵ |
| 100 pc | 50% | Higher |
| 1000 pc | 90% | Much higher |

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper is foundational for understanding:

1. **Detectability**: Our Dyson swarm would be detectable from other star systems
2. **Thermal signatures**: 300 K waste heat is the key detection band
3. **Completion thresholds**: Even partial swarms (50%+) produce measurable signatures
4. **Rarity**: If advanced civilizations exist, Dyson structures appear rare (<0.002%)
