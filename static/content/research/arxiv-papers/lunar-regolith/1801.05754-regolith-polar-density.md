# Experiments Indicate Regolith is Looser in the Lunar Polar Regions than at the Lunar Landing Sites

## Abstract

Since the Apollo program or earlier it has been widely believed that the lunar regolith was compacted through vibrations including nearby impact events, thermal stress release in the regolith, deep moon quakes, and shallow moon quakes. Experiments have shown that vibrations both compact and re-loosen granular materials. This paper presents experimental evidence suggesting that regolith in lunar polar regions may be significantly less dense than at equatorial Apollo landing sites, with important implications for polar base construction and resource extraction.

## Key Findings

- Lunar polar regolith likely less compacted than equatorial sites
- Thermal cycling at poles less intense, reducing vibration-induced compaction
- Impact gardening processes differ between polar and equatorial regions
- Lower density implies different bearing capacity and excavation characteristics
- ISRU operations in polar regions may encounter different soil behavior
- Foundation design must account for regional density variations

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides critical site-specific data for research question rq-1-28:

1. **Research Question rq-1-28 (Lunar Foundation Engineering)**: Polar regions are prime candidates for lunar base construction due to near-constant sunlight and water ice. This paper indicates foundations there may require different designs than at Apollo sites.

2. **Bearing Capacity Variation**: Looser regolith has lower bearing capacity. Foundation sizing for polar installations must account for reduced soil strength.

3. **ISRU Site Selection**: Water ice extraction will occur at poles. Understanding local soil properties informs excavation and processing equipment design.

4. **Settlement Hazards**: Lower density may indicate greater susceptibility to settlement under applied loads. Long-term monitoring requirements may differ.

5. **Dust Behavior**: Loose regolith may present different dust mobilization characteristics during operations.

6. **Design Conservatism**: Site variability argues for conservative foundation design or in-situ testing before construction.
