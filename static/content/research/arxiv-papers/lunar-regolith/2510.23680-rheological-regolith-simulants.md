# Rheological Lunar Regolith Simulants

## Abstract

Regolith simulants are essential for space research and technology development. Yet, their physical properties often differ from those of true planetary soil, particularly when compared to regolith properties in-situ that experience notably reduced gravity. This study focuses on lunar regolith simulants and develops rheological approaches to better match simulant behavior to actual lunar soil under reduced gravity conditions, enabling more accurate ground-based testing of lunar surface systems.

## Key Findings

- Gravity significantly affects regolith mechanical behavior
- Standard simulants may not accurately represent lunar soil behavior under reduced gravity
- Rheological modifications can improve simulant fidelity for Earth-based testing
- Flow properties and angle of repose vary with gravity level
- Particle interactions in low gravity differ from Earth conditions
- Proposed methods for creating gravity-compensated test simulants

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper addresses critical testing methodology gaps for research question rq-1-28:

1. **Research Question rq-1-28 (Lunar Foundation Engineering)**: Foundation designs based on Earth-gravity testing may not accurately predict lunar performance. This paper provides methods to improve ground-based validation testing.

2. **Reduced Gravity Effects**: Understanding how regolith behaves differently in lunar gravity (1/6 g) is essential for excavation, construction, and foundation engineering. The rheological approach offers practical testing solutions.

3. **Simulant Selection**: Not all simulants perform equally well for all tests. This research helps select and modify simulants for specific engineering applications.

4. **ISRU Equipment Design**: Material handling systems for regolith processing must account for reduced-gravity flow behavior. The rheological characterization informs hopper, conveyor, and reactor designs.

5. **Construction Operations**: Pile driving, compaction, and trenching operations will behave differently in lunar gravity. Understanding these differences enables proper equipment sizing.

6. **Ground-Based Testing Protocol**: Before deploying expensive lunar systems, ground testing with properly characterized simulants reduces mission risk.
