# Cohesion and Shear Strength of Compacted Lunar and Martian Regolith Simulants

## Abstract

Shear strength and cohesion of granular materials are important geotechnical properties that play a crucial role in the stability and behavior of lunar and Martian regolith, as well as their terrestrial analog materials. To characterize and predict shear strength and cohesion for future space missions, this study conducted systematic testing of compacted lunar and Martian regolith simulants under various conditions, providing engineering parameters essential for surface infrastructure design.

## Key Findings

- Systematic shear strength measurements for multiple lunar and Martian simulants
- Cohesion values vary significantly with compaction state and moisture content
- Internal friction angles measured for various simulant types
- Compaction increases both cohesion and friction angle
- Results applicable to foundation design and slope stability analysis
- Comparison between different simulant formulations

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides essential geotechnical parameters for research question rq-1-28:

1. **Research Question rq-1-28 (Lunar Foundation Engineering)**: Shear strength and cohesion are the fundamental parameters for foundation bearing capacity calculations. This paper provides measured values for design use.

2. **Bearing Capacity Design**: Foundation sizing for lunar structures requires reliable shear strength data. The systematic testing approach provides design values with appropriate factors of safety.

3. **Slope Stability**: Excavations, berms, and natural slopes on the lunar surface must be analyzed for stability. The friction angle and cohesion data enable these calculations.

4. **Compaction Specifications**: The relationship between compaction and strength informs construction specifications for prepared landing pads and roadways.

5. **Anchor Design**: Tie-down systems for equipment and structures require pullout resistance estimates based on shear strength parameters.

6. **Earthmoving Operations**: Excavation forces and equipment sizing depend on soil strength. These data support construction equipment design.
