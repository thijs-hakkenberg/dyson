# An Open Database of Lunar Regolith and Simulants Properties

## Abstract

Lunar regolith, the layer of unconsolidated material covering the Moon's surface, is central to the science and technology developed for the Moon, notably related to in-situ science investigations, resource utilization, surface infrastructure, and mobility systems. However, data on lunar soil properties are scattered across decades of research. This paper presents an open database consolidating lunar regolith properties from Apollo samples, remote sensing, and simulant characterization studies, providing a comprehensive resource for lunar engineering applications.

## Key Findings

- Comprehensive database of lunar regolith physical and mechanical properties
- Comparison between actual lunar soil and various simulant materials
- Particle size distributions, bulk density, and porosity data consolidated
- Shear strength and cohesion parameters from multiple sources
- Bearing capacity and compressibility data for foundation design
- Identifies gaps in current knowledge and need for in-situ measurements

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This database directly addresses research question rq-1-28 on lunar regolith geotechnical properties:

1. **Research Question rq-1-28 (Lunar Foundation Engineering)**: The consolidated geotechnical data enables preliminary design of foundations for lunar infrastructure. Bearing capacity, settlement, and slope stability calculations require the properties catalogued in this database.

2. **ISRU Operations**: Understanding regolith properties is essential for excavation, transport, and processing of lunar materials. Particle size distributions inform beneficiation system design.

3. **Lunar Base Construction**: Foundation design for habitats, processing facilities, and launch/landing pads requires reliable geotechnical parameters. This database provides design values with associated uncertainties.

4. **Mobility Systems**: Wheel-soil interaction models depend on accurate regolith properties. The database supports trafficability analysis for rovers and construction equipment.

5. **Simulant Selection**: Comparison of simulant properties to actual lunar soil helps select appropriate test materials for Earth-based validation experiments.

6. **Risk Assessment**: Property variability data enables probabilistic design approaches that account for site-specific uncertainty in foundation engineering.
