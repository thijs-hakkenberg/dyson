# Hybrid lunar ISRU plant: a comparative analysis with carbothermal reduction and water extraction

## Abstract

This paper proposes an integrated ISRU system combining two complementary oxygen-production methods from lunar materials. The work examines a new ISRU plant architecture integrating carbothermal reduction of dry regolith and water extraction from icy regolith. Two hybrid configurations are analyzed: a parallel configuration with simultaneous mining at Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR) and illuminated peaks, and a series configuration mining exclusively in PSRs with dry regolith byproducts undergoing carbothermal reduction.

## Key Findings

- **Parallel Configuration**: Simultaneous mining and processing at PSR and illuminated peak locations enables continuous operation but requires distributed infrastructure
- **Series Configuration**: Mining exclusively in PSR with subsequent carbothermal reduction of dry regolith byproducts offers excavation efficiency advantages
- **Mass-Power Tradeoffs**: Series configuration requires higher landed mass investment but optimizes excavation operations
- **Monte Carlo Analysis**: Subsystem-level modeling with uncertainty quantification provides robust performance estimates across environmental parameters
- **Scalability**: The hybrid approach demonstrates pathways to industrial-scale lunar oxygen production

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This research directly supports Phase 0 lunar infrastructure development:

1. **Oxygen Production**: Lunar-derived oxygen is critical for propellant production supporting cislunar logistics and eventual solar system transport
2. **Resource Optimization**: The hybrid approach maximizes resource extraction from diverse lunar terrains, essential for sustained operations
3. **Infrastructure Planning**: The parallel vs. series configuration analysis informs site selection and processing plant architecture decisions
4. **Technology Readiness**: Carbothermal reduction and water extraction represent near-term ISRU technologies that can be demonstrated within Phase 0 timelines
5. **Mass Budget**: Understanding landed mass requirements helps optimize Earth-to-Moon logistics in early project phases
