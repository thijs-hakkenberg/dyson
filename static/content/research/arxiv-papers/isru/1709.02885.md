# Network of Nano-Landers for In-Situ Characterization of Asteroid Impact Studies

## Abstract

This paper proposes deploying numerous small spacecraft to asteroid surfaces for in-situ characterization. The nano-landers would hop, roll, and fly over the asteroid surface, equipped with science instruments including stereo cameras, hand-lens imagers, and spectrometers. The mission concept employs automated machine learning techniques for planning and design optimization using evolutionary algorithms.

## Key Findings

- **Nano-Lander Specifications**: 1 kg mass, 1U (1000 cm3) volume per unit
- **Mobility Modes**: Hopping, rolling, and flight capabilities enable comprehensive surface coverage
- **Instrument Suite**: Stereo cameras, hand-lens imagers, and spectrometers for composition analysis
- **Network Approach**: Multiple coordinated units provide redundancy and distributed sensing
- **ML Optimization**: Evolutionary algorithms optimize lander configurations, instruments, and control systems
- **Subsurface Access**: Impact studies and mobility enable analysis of pristine subsurface material

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This research directly supports Phase 0 asteroid prospecting requirements:

1. **Resource Survey**: Nano-lander networks can rapidly characterize asteroid composition to identify high-value ISRU targets
2. **Low-Cost Prospecting**: Small, mass-produced units enable surveying many candidate asteroids economically
3. **Subsurface Sampling**: Mobility and impact capabilities access materials below space-weathered surfaces
4. **Technology Pathfinder**: The nano-lander concept could evolve into distributed mining and processing systems
5. **Site Selection**: Detailed surface characterization informs optimal locations for larger ISRU infrastructure
6. **Risk Reduction**: Pre-characterization reduces uncertainty in asteroid mining investments
7. **Scalability**: Network architectures align with the distributed, redundant systems philosophy of Dyson construction
