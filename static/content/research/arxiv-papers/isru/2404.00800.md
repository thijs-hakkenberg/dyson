# Methane and oxygen from energy-efficient, low temperature in situ resource utilization enables missions to Mars

## Abstract

This research addresses propellant production for Mars missions using an innovative ISRU approach. The team proposes utilizing Martian resources - water from the planetary cycle combined with perchlorate salts and the planet's 95% CO2 atmosphere - to generate methane propellant and oxygen. The technology operates at ultra-low temperatures (255K) using an electrolyzer combining CO2 and H2O conversion.

## Key Findings

- **Ultra-Low Temperature Operation**: Electrolyzer operates at 255K, significantly lower than existing high-temperature ISRU systems
- **Dual Product Generation**: Simultaneous methane (CH4) and oxygen (O2) production, unlike MOXIE which produces only oxygen
- **Performance Metrics**: Hypothetical 10-cell system produces 0.31g/W/day of CH4 and 3.54g/W/day of O2 at 2V per cell
- **Efficiency Comparison**: MOXIE produces 0.8g/W/day of O2 only; this system exceeds that while also producing fuel
- **Energy Efficiency**: Lower operating temperature translates to reduced power requirements for sustained operations
- **Resource Utilization**: Leverages abundant Martian CO2 atmosphere and water ice deposits

## Relevance to Project Dyson

While Mars-focused, this research has significant implications for Phase 1 asteroid and deep-space ISRU:

1. **Low-Temperature Processing**: Asteroid surface temperatures can be extremely low; techniques operating at 255K are directly applicable to carbonaceous asteroid processing
2. **Propellant Production**: Methane/oxygen propulsion is a candidate for interplanetary transport in the Dyson construction supply chain
3. **CO2 Utilization**: Carbonaceous asteroids contain CO2-bearing minerals; similar electrochemical approaches may extract propellants
4. **Energy Efficiency**: Solar energy availability decreases with distance from the Sun; energy-efficient ISRU is critical for outer solar system operations
5. **Scalability Path**: The electrochemical approach scales more readily than high-temperature systems, supporting distributed processing nodes
