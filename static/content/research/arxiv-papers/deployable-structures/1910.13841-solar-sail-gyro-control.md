# Gyro-Control of a Solar Sailing Satellite

## Abstract

Recent successes in the deployment of sails in space have reduced the risk associated with solar sailing missions. The attitude control requirements for a solar sailing mission is low with only slow attitude maneuvers needed to maintain a stable attitude and produce a required solar thrust. Future solar sail missions will require more agile attitude control for formation flying and station keeping. This paper investigates gyroscopic control methods for solar sail attitude management, enabling precise pointing despite the flexible dynamics of large membrane structures.

## Key Findings

- Gyroscopic actuators effective for solar sail attitude control
- Slow maneuver requirements compatible with momentum-based systems
- Flexible membrane dynamics must be considered in controller design
- Formation flying requires enhanced attitude agility
- Control bandwidth limited by structural flexibility
- Momentum management strategies for long-duration missions

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper addresses attitude control challenges directly relevant to research questions rq-1-7 and rq-2-4:

1. **Research Question rq-1-7 (Large Membrane Deployment Dynamics)**: Solar sails share structural characteristics with large collector unit membranes. The attitude control approaches developed here inform collector unit pointing systems.

2. **Research Question rq-2-4 (Large Structure Control)**: Gyroscopic control methods scale to larger structures. Understanding the interaction between rigid-body and flexible dynamics is essential for collector unit design.

3. **Formation Flying**: Dyson swarm elements must maintain coordinated orientations. The formation flying aspects of this work directly apply to swarm control.

4. **Radiation Pressure Interaction**: Solar sails and collector units both experience significant radiation pressure forces. Control systems must account for these disturbances.

5. **Momentum Management**: Long-duration missions require strategies to prevent momentum saturation. The approaches here inform collector unit design.

6. **Structural Flexibility**: Large membrane structures exhibit flexible modes that interact with attitude control. Understanding these dynamics prevents instabilities.
