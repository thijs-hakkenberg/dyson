# Deployable Prototype Testing and Control Allocation of the CABLESSail Concept for Solar Sail Shape Control and Momentum Management

## Abstract

This paper presents prototype testing and a control allocation algorithm for the Cable-Actuated Bio-inspired Lightweight Elastic Solar Sail (CABLESSail) concept aimed at performing momentum management of a solar sail. CABLESSail uses actuated cables routed along the structural booms of the solar sail to control sail shape and generate control torques. The prototype demonstrates deployment kinematics and validates the control approach through ground-based testing.

## Key Findings

- Hardware prototype validates CABLESSail deployment concept
- Control allocation algorithm distributes torque demands across multiple cable actuators
- Deployment sequence successfully demonstrated in ground testing
- Shape control enables center-of-pressure management for momentum control
- Prototype-scale results extrapolate to flight-scale systems
- Manufacturing approaches identified for cable routing and boom fabrication

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides experimental validation directly applicable to research questions rq-1-7 and rq-2-4:

1. **Research Question rq-1-7 (Large Membrane Deployment Dynamics)**: Hardware testing of deployment kinematics provides ground truth data for validating deployment models. The lessons learned inform collector unit deployment design.

2. **Research Question rq-2-4 (Large Structure Shape Control)**: The control allocation algorithm demonstrates practical implementation of distributed actuation for shape management.

3. **Technology Readiness**: Prototype testing advances the TRL of cable-based control concepts, reducing risk for future missions.

4. **Deployment Reliability**: Understanding deployment failure modes through testing improves design robustness for collector units.

5. **Manufacturing Methods**: Prototype construction reveals practical manufacturing considerations for boom-cable integration.

6. **Scaling Relationships**: Data from prototype testing enables extrapolation to larger flight systems with quantified uncertainty.
