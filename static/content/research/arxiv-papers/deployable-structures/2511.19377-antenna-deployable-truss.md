# Deployment Dynamics and Optimization of Novel Space Antenna Deployable Mechanism

## Abstract

Given the increasing need for large aperture antennas in space missions, the difficulty of fitting such structures into small launch vehicles has prompted the design of deployable antenna systems. This thesis introduces a new Triple Scissors Deployable Truss Mechanism (TSDTM) for space antenna missions. The work presents deployment dynamics analysis, mechanism optimization, and performance characterization for achieving reliable large-aperture deployment from compact stowed configurations.

## Key Findings

- Novel triple scissors mechanism achieves high deployment ratio
- Deployment dynamics analyzed including gravity effects and damping
- Optimization identifies parameter ranges for reliable deployment
- Mechanism suitable for large aperture space antennas
- Stowed volume significantly reduced compared to deployed configuration
- Design methodology applicable to various deployable structure applications

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper addresses deployable structure design challenges relevant to research questions rq-1-7 and rq-2-4:

1. **Research Question rq-1-7 (Large Membrane Deployment Dynamics)**: While focused on truss structures rather than membranes, the deployment dynamics analysis methods apply to understanding collector unit deployment behavior.

2. **Research Question rq-2-4 (Large Structure Deployment)**: The optimization approach for achieving reliable deployment informs design trade studies for collector unit mechanisms.

3. **Packaging Efficiency**: High deployment ratios maximize the deployed area achievable from limited launch volume, essential for the massive scale of Dyson swarm construction.

4. **Mechanism Reliability**: Understanding deployment dynamics helps design mechanisms that deploy reliably without jamming or unexpected behavior.

5. **Scaling Analysis**: The analysis methods can be extended to the larger scales required for collector units.

6. **Design Optimization**: Parameter optimization approaches identify robust design regions that tolerate manufacturing variations.
