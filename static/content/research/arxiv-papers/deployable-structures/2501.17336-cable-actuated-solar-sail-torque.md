# Static and Dynamic Torque Generation Analysis of a Cable-Actuated Solar Sail

## Abstract

This paper presents a static and dynamic torque analysis of the CABLESSail concept, which involves cables routed along the length of the flexible booms that hold the solar sail membrane in such a manner that tensioning the cables results in a bending deformation of the booms. This provides a mechanism for attitude control without conventional thrusters, enabling propellant-free operation for long-duration missions. The analysis characterizes torque generation capabilities and dynamic response of the coupled boom-membrane system.

## Key Findings

- Cable actuation enables propellant-free attitude control for membrane spacecraft
- Boom bending provides controllable torque through center-of-pressure shift
- Dynamic coupling between boom flexibility and membrane response characterized
- Control authority sufficient for typical solar sail maneuvers
- System mass penalty modest compared to conventional control systems
- Approach scalable to larger membrane structures

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper presents innovative control concepts applicable to research questions rq-1-7 and rq-2-4:

1. **Research Question rq-1-7 (Large Membrane Deployment Dynamics)**: The boom-membrane coupling analysis directly applies to understanding collector unit structural behavior during and after deployment.

2. **Research Question rq-2-4 (Large Structure Shape Control)**: Active shape control via cable actuation could enable precise collector geometry maintenance despite thermal gradients and radiation pressure.

3. **Propellant-Free Operation**: Collector units must operate for extended periods without resupply. Cable-based control eliminates propellant consumption for attitude maintenance.

4. **Scalability Analysis**: The paper's analysis methods can be extended to the larger scales required for collector units.

5. **Structural Integration**: Cable routing along booms provides an integrated approach that could simplify collector unit mechanical design.

6. **Dynamic Modeling**: The coupled dynamic models developed here inform control system design for flexible space structures.
