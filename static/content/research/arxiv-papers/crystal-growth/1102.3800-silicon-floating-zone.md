# Growth Angle and Melt Meniscus of the RF-heated Floating Zone in Silicon Crystal Growth

## Abstract

This article presents a direct measurement of the growth angle during the growth of a cylindrical 2" silicon crystal using a radio-frequency heated floating zone process. From the high-resolution pictures taken during the process, this growth angle was evaluated to be 11 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees. Furthermore, the free melt surface shape (meniscus) was analyzed and compared to calculations based on the Young-Laplace equation. The study provides key data for understanding containerless melt processing relevant to space manufacturing.

## Key Findings

- Direct measurement of growth angle (11 plus or minus 2 degrees) during RF-heated floating zone silicon crystal growth
- High-resolution imaging enables real-time observation of melt meniscus shape
- Meniscus shape follows Young-Laplace equation predictions
- RF heating provides containerless processing suitable for high-purity applications
- Growth stability depends on maintaining proper thermal gradients and growth angles
- Process parameters can be optimized for different crystal diameters

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper addresses fundamental aspects of zone refining and crystal growth that are directly relevant to Project Dyson research questions:

1. **Research Question rq-0-12 (Zone Refining in Microgravity)**: The floating zone technique is inherently containerless, making it ideal for microgravity environments where crucible contamination and convection effects are minimized. Understanding growth angles and meniscus behavior on Earth provides baseline data for microgravity experiments.

2. **Research Question rq-2-14 (Space-Based Material Processing)**: The RF heating approach demonstrated here could be adapted for space-based silicon processing, enabling production of high-purity semiconductor materials for collector unit manufacturing.

3. **Silicon for Photovoltaics**: High-purity silicon produced via floating zone methods is essential for efficient solar cells. This paper provides process parameters relevant to scaling up production.

4. **Containerless Processing**: The absence of crucible contact eliminates contamination sources, which is critical for space manufacturing where material purity directly impacts device performance.

5. **Process Control Parameters**: The measured growth angles and meniscus shapes provide design criteria for automated zone refining systems that could operate autonomously in space.
