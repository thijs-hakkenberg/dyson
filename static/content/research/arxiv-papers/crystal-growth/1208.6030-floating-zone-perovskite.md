# Floating Zone Growth of Large Single Crystals of SrFeO_3-x

## Abstract

The Fe4+ containing cubic perovskite phase SrFeO_3-x is of interest both for its high-temperature, oxygen-conducting properties as a solid oxide fuel cell component, and at low temperatures, where it exhibits a plethora of helical magnetic phases and a candidate Skyrmion lattice. This paper reports on the successful growth of large single crystals using the optical floating-zone method, demonstrating the technique's capability for producing high-quality oxide crystals for advanced applications.

## Key Findings

- Successful growth of large single crystals of complex oxide materials via floating zone technique
- Optical heating provides precise temperature control for oxide crystal growth
- Atmosphere control (oxygen partial pressure) is critical for maintaining proper stoichiometry
- Crystal quality suitable for detailed physical property measurements
- Method applicable to a range of functional oxide materials
- Containerless processing prevents contamination from crucible materials

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper demonstrates floating zone crystal growth for complex oxide materials, with implications for Project Dyson:

1. **Research Question rq-0-12 (Zone Refining in Microgravity)**: While focused on oxides rather than semiconductors, this work demonstrates that floating zone methods can produce large, high-quality crystals. The techniques could be adapted for silicon and other materials relevant to space manufacturing.

2. **Research Question rq-2-14 (Advanced Materials Processing)**: The optical heating approach shown here is scalable and could be powered by concentrated solar energy in space, enabling autonomous material processing.

3. **Functional Oxide Materials**: Oxygen-conducting materials like SrFeO_3-x may have applications in space-based fuel cells or oxygen extraction systems for ISRU operations.

4. **High-Temperature Processing**: The demonstrated capability for handling materials at elevated temperatures in a controlled atmosphere informs design requirements for space-based furnaces.

5. **Crystal Quality Control**: The characterization methods used (XRD, magnetic measurements) provide quality assurance approaches applicable to space manufacturing.
