# Axial vs. Radial Junction Nanowire Solar Cell

## Abstract

Both axial and radial junction nanowire solar cells have their challenges and advantages. However, so far, there is no review that explicitly provides a detailed comparative analysis of both axial and radial junction solar cells. This article reviews some of the recent results on axial and radial junction nanowire solar cells with an attempt to perform a comparative study between the optical and device behavior of these cells. In particular, the review covers how absorption can be tuned in axial and radial junction solar cells, discusses critical device concepts required to achieve high efficiency, includes new device concepts realizable in nanowire structures, and concludes by discussing standing challenges of nanowire solar cells.

## Key Findings

- **Architecture Comparison**: Provides systematic comparison of axial junction (along nanowire length) vs. radial junction (core-shell) configurations.

- **Absorption Tuning**: Both architectures offer unique opportunities for light absorption engineering through nanowire geometry and arrangement.

- **Axial Junction Advantages**:
  - Simpler fabrication process
  - Better suited for tandem/multi-junction designs
  - More straightforward current collection

- **Radial Junction Advantages**:
  - Shorter carrier collection distances (radial direction)
  - Higher tolerance to material defects
  - Enhanced light trapping through scattering

- **Standing Challenges**: Identifies key obstacles including surface recombination, contact formation, and scalable manufacturing.

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Nanowire solar cells represent a potential next-generation technology for space solar power:

1. **Material Efficiency**: Nanowire architectures use significantly less semiconductor material than planar cells while maintaining or improving light absorption - critical for mass-constrained space applications.

2. **Defect Tolerance**: Radial junction designs' tolerance to material defects could enable use of lower-purity (cheaper) materials, reducing manufacturing cost at scale.

3. **Light Trapping**: Enhanced absorption per unit material could enable thinner, lighter collector units with equivalent power output.

4. **Radiation Hardness Potential**: The small dimensions of nanowires may provide inherent radiation tolerance, as defects can more easily reach surfaces and anneal out.

5. **Tandem Integration**: Axial junction architecture's compatibility with tandem designs aligns with the multi-junction approach for maximum efficiency.

**Technology Readiness Considerations**:
- Nanowire solar cells are still primarily in research phase
- Manufacturing scalability remains unproven for large areas
- Best suited for Phase 2 timeline when technology matures
- Current best nanowire efficiencies lag behind planar multi-junction cells

**Phase Assignment**: Assigned to Phase 2 due to current technology readiness level; could become relevant to Phase 1 if rapid progress occurs.
