# Moon's Radiation Environment and Expected Performance of Solar Cells during Future Lunar Missions

## Abstract

Several lunar missions are planned ahead and there is an increasing demand for efficient photovoltaic power generation on the Moon. The knowledge of solar cell operation on the lunar surface obtained during the early seventies needs to be updated considering current views on solar variability and emerging solar cell technologies. This paper calculates the relative output power from various solar cell types under extreme solar proton irradiation and high daytime temperatures on the lunar surface. Key findings indicate 2-3% annual solar cell degradation is most probable during future lunar missions. The paper explores technological improvements including sunlight concentration, solar cell cooling, and magnetic radiation shielding to enhance efficiency in the lunar environment.

## Key Findings

- **Radiation Degradation Rate**: 2-3% annual degradation expected from solar proton irradiation - provides baseline for long-duration mission planning.

- **Temperature Effects**: Lunar daytime temperatures significantly impact solar cell performance, requiring active or passive thermal management.

- **Mitigation Strategies**: Three key approaches identified:
  - Sunlight concentration to increase power density
  - Active solar cell cooling systems
  - Magnetic shielding for radiation protection

- **Technology Updates**: Updates 1970s-era understanding with modern solar cell technologies and improved solar variability models.

- **Multi-Cell Comparison**: Evaluates performance of various solar cell types under lunar conditions, enabling technology selection.

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper addresses radiation and thermal challenges directly applicable to Dyson swarm collector design:

1. **Radiation Degradation Baseline**: The 2-3% annual degradation rate provides a conservative baseline for estimating collector lifetime and replacement rates. Near-solar operation would experience higher flux, requiring extrapolation.

2. **Thermal Management Imperative**: The documented temperature effects on lunar solar cells underscore the critical importance of thermal design for collectors operating at closer solar distances where temperatures are significantly higher.

3. **Shielding Concepts**: Magnetic radiation shielding concepts could inform collector protection strategies, though the mass penalty would need evaluation against replacement economics.

4. **Concentration Optics**: Sunlight concentration techniques could increase power density per collector unit, potentially offsetting radiation degradation through higher initial output.

5. **Lifetime Modeling**: The degradation models provide framework for collector replacement scheduling and total-cost-of-ownership calculations.

**Key Consideration**: Near-solar collectors will face orders of magnitude higher radiation flux than lunar surface installations. The 2-3% figure should be treated as a lower bound, with actual degradation rates requiring detailed modeling of the solar radiation environment at operational distances.
