# Coupled Optoelectronic Simulation and Optimization of Thin-Film Photovoltaic Solar Cells

## Abstract

The researchers developed a computational design tool for enhancing the performance of inorganic thin-film photovoltaic solar cells. Their approach integrates multiple techniques: the rigorous coupled-wave method calculates electron-hole generation rates, while the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method solves equations governing charge transport in semiconductor layers. The system optimizes solar-cell efficiency by varying semiconductor layer dimensions and bandgaps using differential evolution algorithms. The design framework accommodates multiple semiconductor layers, antireflection coatings, passivation layers, buffer layers, and a periodic metallic grating backing.

## Key Findings

- **Integrated Simulation Framework**: Combines optical and electronic simulation for accurate efficiency prediction, avoiding the limitations of decoupled approaches.

- **Rigorous Coupled-Wave Method**: Provides accurate calculation of photon absorption and electron-hole pair generation across thin-film structures.

- **Differential Evolution Optimization**: Enables automated optimization of layer thicknesses and bandgaps without requiring gradient information.

- **Multi-Layer Flexibility**: Framework handles complex cell architectures including:
  - Multiple semiconductor absorber layers
  - Antireflection coatings
  - Passivation and buffer layers
  - Metallic back reflectors with periodic gratings

- **Manufacturable Designs**: Optimization can be constrained to produce designs achievable with current fabrication technology.

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides computational tools applicable to collector unit solar cell optimization:

1. **Thin-Film Priority**: Thin-film cells are prime candidates for Dyson swarm collectors due to their low mass-to-area ratio, making this optimization framework directly relevant.

2. **Space Spectrum Optimization**: The simulation framework can be adapted to optimize for the unfiltered solar spectrum (AM0) rather than terrestrial spectra, potentially identifying different optimal designs.

3. **Multi-Junction Design**: The multi-layer capability enables simulation of tandem and multi-junction cells that could achieve higher efficiencies critical for megastructure economics.

4. **Manufacturing Constraints**: The ability to constrain optimization to manufacturable designs aligns with Project Dyson's emphasis on achievable near-term technology.

5. **Trade-off Analysis**: The framework enables systematic exploration of efficiency vs. complexity trade-offs, informing collector unit design decisions.

**Application Considerations**: The optimization targets would need modification for space applications:
- AM0 spectrum instead of AM1.5
- Extended temperature range operation
- Radiation hardness considerations
- Mass minimization as secondary objective
