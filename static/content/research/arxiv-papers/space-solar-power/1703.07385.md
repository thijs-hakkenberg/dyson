# High-Fidelity Solar Power Income Modeling for Solar-Electric UAVs

## Abstract

Solar power models are a crucial element of solar-powered UAV design and performance analysis. During the conceptual design phase, their accuracy directly relates to the accuracy of predicted performance metrics and thus the final design characteristics of the solar-powered UAV. This work presents an advanced solar power model incorporating aircraft orientation, geometric factors, temperature effects, and radiation angles. The research derives simplified variants suitable for early design phases and validates all models against actual flight test data from a 28-hour continuous solar-powered flight. The high-fidelity model achieves prediction of the average solar power income with an error of less than 5%, compared to approximately 18% error in prior approaches.

## Key Findings

- **5% Prediction Accuracy**: High-fidelity model achieves <5% error in power prediction, a significant improvement over 18% error in simpler models.

- **Key Modeling Factors**:
  - Platform orientation (pitch, roll, yaw)
  - Geometric shadowing and occlusion
  - Temperature-dependent cell efficiency
  - Solar radiation angle of incidence

- **Tiered Model Complexity**: Provides both simplified models for early design and detailed models for operational planning.

- **Flight Validation**: 28-hour continuous flight test provides real-world validation dataset.

- **Design Integration**: Model accuracy directly impacts design optimization - 13% error reduction translates to more efficient final designs.

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides methodological insights for Dyson swarm power prediction:

1. **Orientation Effects**: Collector units in a swarm will have varying orientations relative to the Sun. Understanding how orientation affects power output is critical for swarm formation planning and total power estimation.

2. **Geometric Modeling**: The geometric factors (shadowing, occlusion, incidence angles) scale to swarm-level analysis where collector units may partially shade each other.

3. **Temperature Modeling**: Temperature-dependent efficiency is directly relevant to near-solar operation where thermal management is critical.

4. **Tiered Modeling Approach**: The concept of simplified models for early design phases and high-fidelity models for operations maps well to Project Dyson's phased approach.

5. **Validation Methodology**: The flight-test validation approach provides a template for validating collector unit power models against prototype data.

**Adaptation Requirements**:
- Model assumes atmospheric scattering (terrestrial); space application simpler in some respects
- UAV geometry differs significantly from planar collectors
- Swarm mutual shadowing requires extension of occlusion modeling
- Near-solar thermal environment more extreme than terrestrial

**Key Insight**: The 13% improvement in prediction accuracy from proper modeling demonstrates the value of high-fidelity simulation for design optimization - directly applicable to collector unit specification.
