# Hypermodular Distributed Solar Power Satellites

## Abstract

This paper presents a new and innovative design for scalable space solar power systems based on satellite self-assembly and microwave spatial power combination. Lower system cost of utility-scale space solar power is achieved by independence of yet-to-be-built in-space assembly and transportation infrastructure. Using currently available and near-future technologies, the research examines designs for near-term low-Earth orbit demonstration projects and mid-term utility-scale installations in geosynchronous Laplace plane orbits (GLPO), along with economic analysis considering current and projected launch expenses.

This submission won the 2013 Space Solar Power International Student and Young Professional Design Competition.

## Key Findings

- **Self-Assembly Architecture**: Proposes hypermodular satellite design where individual units autonomously assemble in orbit, eliminating the need for complex in-space assembly infrastructure
- **Microwave Spatial Power Combination**: Uses distributed microwave transmitters that combine power coherently, enabling scalable power transmission without monolithic antenna structures
- **Near-Term Feasibility**: Designs are based on currently available or near-future technologies, making LEO demonstrations achievable with existing capabilities
- **Economic Analysis**: Provides cost projections for both demonstration and utility-scale systems, accounting for declining launch costs
- **GLPO Placement**: Identifies geosynchronous Laplace plane orbit as optimal for full-scale plants, balancing accessibility with stable orbital dynamics

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper is highly relevant to Phase 1 collector unit design for several reasons:

1. **Modular Self-Assembly**: The hypermodular approach directly aligns with Project Dyson's vision of scalable, self-assembling collector units. The autonomous assembly concepts could inform early-phase deployment strategies.

2. **Microwave Power Transmission**: The spatial power combination technique addresses a key challenge in Dyson swarm design - transmitting collected solar energy efficiently. The distributed transmitter array approach scales naturally with swarm size.

3. **Incremental Deployment**: The paper's progression from LEO demonstration to GLPO utility-scale mirrors Project Dyson's phased approach, providing a realistic technology roadmap.

4. **Cost Reduction Strategy**: By eliminating dependence on dedicated in-space assembly infrastructure, the approach reduces initial capital requirements - critical for Phase 1 economics.

5. **Technology Readiness**: The emphasis on near-term technologies provides a realistic baseline for early collector unit specifications.

**Limitations for Dyson Applications**: The paper focuses on Earth-orbit power transmission, not solar-proximity operation. Thermal management at closer solar distances would require significant design modifications.
