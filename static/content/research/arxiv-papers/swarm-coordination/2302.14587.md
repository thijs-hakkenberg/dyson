# Decentralised construction of a global coordinate system in a large swarm of minimalistic robots

## Abstract

Collective intelligence and autonomy of robot swarms can be improved by enabling the individual robots to become aware they are the constituent units of a larger whole and what is their role. In this study, we present an algorithm to enable positional self-awareness in a swarm of minimalistic error-prone robots. The algorithm allows each robot to determine its position within a global coordinate system constructed entirely through local interactions, without any centralized infrastructure or external positioning systems. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in swarms of varying sizes and analyze its robustness to communication errors and robot failures.

## Key Findings

- **Decentralized localization**: Robots construct a global coordinate system using only local communication with neighbors - no GPS, no centralized infrastructure
- **Error tolerance**: The algorithm is robust to communication errors and individual robot failures, critical for real-world deployment
- **Minimalistic requirements**: Works with simple robots having limited sensing, computation, and communication capabilities
- **Scalability demonstrated**: Validated on swarms of varying sizes, showing the approach scales to large populations
- **Positional self-awareness**: Enables each robot to know its position within the swarm, unlocking higher-level coordination behaviors
- **Iterative refinement**: The coordinate system improves over time through repeated local interactions

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper addresses a fundamental challenge for Dyson swarm operations - how can millions of collector units know their position without centralized infrastructure:

1. **GPS-free localization**: In a Dyson swarm, there is no GPS. This paper's approach of constructing coordinates from local interactions is directly applicable to space-based swarms where external positioning infrastructure doesn't exist.

2. **Essential for formation control**: Precise position knowledge is required for:
   - Maintaining optimal inter-collector spacing
   - Coordinating beam-pointing for energy transmission
   - Avoiding collisions during reconfiguration
   - Planning maintenance operations

3. **Minimalistic robot compatibility**: Collector units must be simple and cheap to produce in the millions. This algorithm's minimal requirements align with the need for simple, mass-producible units.

4. **Fault tolerance**: The decentralized approach means that failures of individual units don't compromise the coordinate system - remaining units can reconstruct coordinates from their neighbors.

5. **Self-healing capability**: As units fail and are replaced, new units can automatically determine their position by communicating with neighbors.

## Applicability to Million-Unit Swarms

- **Hierarchical coordinate systems**: For Dyson-scale swarms, hierarchical coordinate systems could provide different precision at different scales (local high precision, global coarse position)
- **Anchor points**: Designated high-accuracy units could serve as anchor points to reduce coordinate drift over large distances
- **Dynamic updates**: The coordinate system can continuously update to account for orbital dynamics and unit movements
- **Bandwidth efficiency**: Local-only communication keeps bandwidth requirements manageable even at extreme scale
