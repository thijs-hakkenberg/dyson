# Buzz: An Extensible Programming Language for Self-Organizing Heterogeneous Robot Swarms

## Abstract

We present Buzz, a novel programming language for heterogeneous robot swarms. Buzz advocates a compositional approach, offering primitives to define swarm behaviors both from the perspective of the single robot and of the overall swarm. Single-robot primitives include robot-specific instructions and manipulation of neighborhood data. Swarm-level primitives allow for the definition of dynamic groups of robots, their topology, and the creation of gradients across the swarm. Buzz programs are compiled into bytecode that can run on any robot platform, making the language platform-independent. We demonstrate Buzz with several swarm robotics scenarios and show its applicability to heterogeneous robot teams.

## Key Findings

- **Dual-perspective programming**: Provides primitives for both individual robot behavior and emergent swarm behavior, bridging the micro-macro gap in swarm programming
- **Virtual stigmergy**: Implements stigmergic communication (indirect coordination through the environment) as a language primitive, enabling efficient distributed coordination
- **Dynamic swarm partitioning**: Allows runtime creation and dissolution of robot groups based on spatial or logical criteria
- **Gradient-based coordination**: Built-in support for distance gradients enabling spatial coordination patterns like rendezvous and dispersion
- **Heterogeneous support**: Explicitly designed for swarms with different robot types, each with different capabilities
- **Platform independence**: Compiles to bytecode that runs on any robot platform with a Buzz Virtual Machine

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Buzz represents a significant advancement in swarm programming paradigms directly applicable to Dyson swarm coordination:

1. **Heterogeneous unit types**: A Dyson swarm will likely include multiple unit types (collectors, maintenance bots, communication relays, etc.). Buzz's explicit support for heterogeneous swarms provides a programming model for coordinating different unit types.

2. **Scalable abstractions**: The swarm-level primitives (stigmergy, gradients, dynamic groups) are designed to scale to large swarms. These abstractions hide the complexity of million-unit coordination behind intuitive programming constructs.

3. **Self-organization primitives**: Built-in support for self-organizing behaviors (gradient formation, swarm partitioning) maps directly to Dyson swarm operations like:
   - Forming collector arrays at optimal distances from the Sun
   - Partitioning swarm into maintenance regions
   - Coordinating collector orientation changes

4. **Stigmergic coordination**: Virtual stigmergy provides an efficient coordination mechanism that doesn't require direct communication between all units - essential when direct communication is limited by distance and power.

5. **Runtime adaptability**: The ability to dynamically create and dissolve groups enables adaptive response to changing conditions (solar flares, unit failures, reconfiguration commands).

## Applicability to Million-Unit Swarms

- **Hierarchical group structures**: Buzz's dynamic groups could be nested hierarchically for Dyson-scale coordination
- **Gradient propagation**: Distance gradients can propagate coordination signals across large swarms with only local communication
- **Bytecode deployment**: Platform-independent bytecode enables uniform software updates across heterogeneous units
- **Stigmergy for scale**: Stigmergic coordination scales better than direct communication as swarm size increases
