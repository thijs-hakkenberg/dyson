# Graph Neural Networks for Learning Robot Team Coordination

## Abstract

This paper shows how Graph Neural Networks can be used for learning distributed coordination mechanisms in connected teams of robots. We capture the relational aspect of robot coordination by modeling the robot team as a graph, where each robot is a node, and edges represent communication links. During training, the weights of the neural network are optimized to produce optimal actions for each individual robot, given information about its local neighborhood. The learned policies are distributed and can generalize to teams of different sizes than seen during training.

## Key Findings

- **Graph-based representation**: Models robot teams as dynamic graphs where nodes are robots and edges are communication links, naturally capturing the distributed nature of swarm coordination
- **Distributed policy learning**: Learns coordination policies that operate using only local information from neighboring robots
- **Size generalization**: Trained policies generalize to team sizes not seen during training - critical for scalable swarm systems
- **Communication-aware**: The graph structure explicitly models communication topology, allowing the network to learn efficient message passing
- **Task-agnostic framework**: The approach is general and can be applied to various coordination tasks including formation control, coverage, and collective transport

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper presents a foundational approach for learning scalable coordination in robot swarms that is highly applicable to Dyson swarm operations:

1. **Scalable coordination policies**: The ability to train on small swarms and deploy on arbitrarily large swarms is essential for Phase 2 collector unit coordination. Training coordination policies on millions of units would be computationally infeasible, but GNN-based approaches can learn transferable policies.

2. **Local communication model**: The graph-based approach aligns with the physical constraints of a Dyson swarm where each collector unit can only communicate with nearby units. The learned policies respect these communication constraints by design.

3. **Emergent global behavior**: Like biological swarms, GNN-based coordination produces emergent global behavior from local interactions - exactly the paradigm needed for self-organizing Dyson swarm maintenance.

4. **Fault tolerance through distribution**: Since each unit runs the same distributed policy with only local information, the system naturally tolerates individual unit failures.

5. **Adaptability**: GNN-based policies can adapt to changing network topology as units fail, are added, or reconfigure - essential for a long-lived megastructure.

## Applicability to Million-Unit Swarms

- **Hierarchical GNNs**: For Dyson-scale swarms, hierarchical graph structures could enable coordination at multiple scales (local clusters, regional groups, global swarm)
- **Sparse communication graphs**: The approach naturally handles sparse communication graphs where each unit connects to only a few neighbors
- **Online adaptation**: GNN weights could be updated online to adapt to changing conditions over the swarm's operational lifetime
- **Computational efficiency**: GNN inference is computationally lightweight, suitable for resource-constrained collector units
