# The Proposed Silicate-Sulfuric Acid Process: Mineral Processing for ISRU

## Abstract

This paper proposes an alternative ISRU methodology focusing on sulfur extraction from extraterrestrial sulfide minerals rather than conventional water-based approaches. The process involves extracting sulfur from native sulfide minerals, manufacturing sulfuric acid in situ, and using the produced acid to dissolve silicate materials. The outputs include iron metal, silica, oxygen, and various metal oxides - resources valuable for space-based construction. While the process requires initial inputs of water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, these materials are recovered and recycled throughout the operation. The authors calculated potential yields for lunar highlands, lunar mare, Martian surfaces, and various asteroid compositions.

## Key Findings

- Proposes a novel closed-loop chemical process for extracting metals from silicate minerals
- Sulfuric acid serves as the primary reagent, produced from sulfide minerals found in asteroids
- Process outputs include: metallic iron, silica (SiO2), oxygen gas, and various metal oxides (MgO, CaO, Al2O3)
- Initial reactants (H2O, O2, CO2) are recycled, making the process sustainable after startup
- Calculated yields vary significantly by target body composition
- S-type asteroids and lunar mare provide favorable feedstocks
- Process temperatures and pressures are achievable with current technology
- Iron extraction efficiency exceeds 90% for appropriate feedstocks
- Silica production enables glass and ceramic manufacturing in space
- Metal oxide byproducts have applications in construction materials and oxygen production

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper is directly relevant to Phase 1 processing infrastructure for Dyson swarm construction:

**Alternative to Water-Based ISRU**: Most ISRU concepts focus on water extraction, but this process works with the more abundant silicate and sulfide minerals. For megastructure construction requiring massive quantities of metals and structural materials, this expands the viable feedstock options significantly.

**Iron Production**: Metallic iron is a primary structural material for space-based construction. The high extraction efficiency (>90%) and the ability to process common silicate minerals makes this process highly attractive for producing structural components.

**Silica for Solar Collectors**: The silica output is essential for manufacturing solar panel components. Dyson swarm collectors require vast quantities of silicon-based materials for photovoltaic or reflective elements.

**Oxygen Production**: The oxygen byproduct supports life support systems and can be used as oxidizer for propellants. This dual benefit improves the overall economics of processing operations.

**Closed-Loop Operation**: The recycling of reactants means the process can operate indefinitely once started, requiring only mineral feedstock. This is essential for sustained large-scale production.

**Asteroid-Specific Yields**: The calculated yields for different asteroid types enable target selection optimization. C-type asteroids rich in sulfides would be particularly valuable as sulfuric acid feedstock sources.

**Process Integration**: The multiple useful outputs (iron, silica, oxygen, metal oxides) enable integrated manufacturing facilities that produce diverse construction materials from a single feedstock stream.
