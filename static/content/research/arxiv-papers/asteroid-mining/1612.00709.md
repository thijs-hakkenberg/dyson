# ASIME 2016 White Paper: In-Space Utilisation of Asteroids

## Abstract

This white paper documents the proceedings from the Asteroid Science Intersections with In-Space Mine Engineering (ASIME) 2016 conference held in Luxembourg City. The conference brought together asteroid scientists and representatives from space mining companies including Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries, and TransAstra. The paper organizes industry questions into categories covering survey, surface, and subsurface asteroid properties, with responses from scientist presentations and collaborative contributions. The document identifies Science Knowledge Gaps (SKGs) critical for advancing asteroid in-space resource utilization.

## Key Findings

- Establishes a framework for collaboration between asteroid scientists and space mining engineers
- Identifies 81 pages of detailed questions and answers about asteroid properties relevant to mining operations
- Categorizes knowledge gaps into survey properties (detection, orbital characteristics), surface properties (regolith, composition), and subsurface properties (internal structure, volatiles)
- Documents the specific technical questions that mining companies need answered before committing to extraction missions
- Highlights the importance of understanding asteroid heterogeneity for resource estimation
- Addresses the challenge of correlating meteorite samples with asteroid parent bodies
- Discusses the need for improved spectroscopic techniques for remote resource assessment

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This white paper is foundational for Phase 0 of Project Dyson because it directly addresses the knowledge gaps that must be closed before asteroid mining operations can begin at scale. For Dyson swarm construction, the insights are critical in several ways:

**Resource Survey Requirements**: The paper establishes what survey capabilities are needed to identify high-value asteroid targets. For a Dyson swarm requiring massive quantities of metals and silicates, understanding how to rapidly assess asteroid composition remotely is essential for mission planning.

**Material Property Knowledge**: The document identifies key uncertainties about asteroid mechanical properties that affect excavation and processing equipment design. This informs the development of mining infrastructure specifications in Phase 1.

**Target Selection Criteria**: The white paper provides frameworks for evaluating asteroid accessibility (delta-v requirements) versus resource value trade-offs. For megastructure construction, selecting the right asteroid targets could reduce total mission mass by orders of magnitude.

**Science-Engineering Interface**: The collaborative model demonstrated here between scientists and engineers provides a template for how Project Dyson can integrate academic research with engineering requirements.
