# A Techno-Economic Analysis of Asteroid Mining

## Abstract

This paper examines the economic feasibility of asteroid mining operations through a comprehensive techno-economic model. The analysis covers both in-space resource provision (water) and Earth-bound platinum returns.

## Key Findings

Critical technological drivers for mission viability:
1. **Throughput rate**: Processing speed determines ROI
2. **Number of spacecraft per mission**: Fleet size economics
3. **Mission succession rate**: Learning curve benefits from rapid iteration
4. **Spacecraft reuse**: Dramatically improves economics

## Economic Model Components

- Capital costs (spacecraft development, launch)
- Operating costs (mission control, propellant)
- Revenue streams (water for in-space use, platinum for Earth return)
- Learning curve effects across successive missions

## Sensitivity Analysis

| Variable | Impact on Viability |
|----------|---------------------|
| Throughput rate | High |
| Spacecraft mass | Medium |
| Resource pricing | High |
| Reuse rate | High |

## Relevance to Project Dyson Phase 0

Directly applicable to our mining operations planning:

1. **Economic framework**: Validates our cost estimation approach
2. **Fleet sizing**: Supports our 20-unit mining robot fleet
3. **Throughput targets**: Benchmarks for material processing rates
4. **Reusability**: Confirms importance of durable, reusable systems
