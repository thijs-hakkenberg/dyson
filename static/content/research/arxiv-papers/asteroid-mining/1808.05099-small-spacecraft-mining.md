# Asteroid Mining with Small Spacecraft and Economic Feasibility

## Abstract

This paper examines using small spacecraft (under 500 kg) for asteroid mining operations, proposing water extraction through microwave heating at 2 Wh/g efficiency.

## Key Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Spacecraft mass | <500 kg |
| Payload per trip | 100 kg water |
| Delta-V capacity | 437 m/s one-way |
| Target distance | ≤0.03 AU from Earth orbit |
| Spacecraft cost | $113.6M each |
| Break-even fleet | 100+ spacecraft |
| Required lifetime | 5+ years operational |

## Water Extraction Method

- **Technique**: Microwave heating of regolith
- **Energy requirement**: 2 Wh/g water extracted
- **Processing**: In-situ on asteroid surface
- **Storage**: Cryogenic or compressed

## Swarm Architecture Benefits

1. Risk distribution across multiple units
2. Parallel processing capability
3. Graceful degradation on unit failure
4. Incremental deployment possible

## Relevance to Project Dyson Phase 0

Key insights for our mining robot design:

1. **Small spacecraft viable**: Validates our modular approach
2. **Microwave extraction**: Proven energy-efficient method
3. **Fleet economics**: Supports our 20-unit fleet sizing
4. **5-year lifetime**: Aligns with our durability requirements
