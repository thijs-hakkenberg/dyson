# ASIME 2018 White Paper: Asteroid Composition

## Abstract

This white paper documents outcomes from the ASIME 2018 workshop held in Belval, Luxembourg, bringing together approximately 70 scientists and engineers. The document addresses 21 questions from asteroid mining companies organized into four major themes: identifying potential targets, establishing asteroid-meteorite connections, performing in-situ measurements, and conducting laboratory analysis. The work explores current understanding of asteroid composition through remote sensing, interpretation of spectral observations, and future research directions through ground-based observations, space-based observations, and sample return missions.

## Key Findings

- Provides detailed answers to 21 specific questions posed by asteroid mining companies about composition characterization
- Establishes methodologies for linking meteorite samples to asteroid parent bodies (the meteorite-asteroid connection)
- Identifies the capabilities and limitations of current spectroscopic techniques for remote composition assessment
- Documents the importance of sample return missions (Hayabusa2, OSIRIS-REx) for ground-truthing remote observations
- Addresses the challenge of space weathering effects on spectral signatures
- Highlights the heterogeneity of asteroid surfaces and the implications for resource estimation
- Discusses water and volatile content detection techniques critical for ISRU applications
- Identifies spectral features indicative of metal content, hydration, and organic compounds

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This white paper is essential for Phase 0 planning as it provides the technical foundation for asteroid resource assessment. For Dyson swarm construction:

**Composition Characterization**: Understanding asteroid composition is fundamental to determining which asteroids contain the materials needed for solar collector construction. The paper provides methods for identifying metal-rich (M-type) asteroids for structural components and carbonaceous (C-type) asteroids for volatiles and carbon-based materials.

**Remote Sensing Capabilities**: The document establishes what can be determined about asteroid composition before arrival, enabling mission planning optimization. For a large-scale construction project, accurate pre-mission resource estimates reduce risk and improve logistics.

**Ground Truth Validation**: The paper emphasizes the importance of sample return missions for validating remote sensing. The Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx results discussed will inform calibration of spectroscopic resource assessment techniques.

**Processing Requirements**: Understanding the mineralogical form of resources (not just elemental abundance) is critical for processing equipment design. Iron in silicate minerals requires different extraction processes than iron in metallic form.

**Water Detection**: Methods for detecting hydrated minerals and water ice are crucial for ISRU propellant production, which enables the orbital logistics needed for Dyson swarm construction.
