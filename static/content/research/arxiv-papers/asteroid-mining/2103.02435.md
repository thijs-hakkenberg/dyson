# Furthering Asteroid Resource Utilization in the Next Decade

## Abstract

This 7-page whitepaper, submitted to the Planetary Science Decadal Survey, identifies significant opportunities for synergy between basic research and asteroid resource development. The authors survey the state of the art in asteroid resource utilization and recommend approaches to bridge existing knowledge gaps. The goal is enabling economic expansion through space-based resource use, with practical timelines for technology development.

## Key Findings

- Identifies key technology gaps that must be closed for asteroid resource utilization to become viable
- Proposes a roadmap for integrating asteroid science with commercial resource development
- Highlights the mutual benefits of scientific missions and commercial prospecting activities
- Addresses the importance of technology demonstrations for excavation, extraction, and processing
- Discusses propellant production from asteroid-derived water as an enabling capability
- Emphasizes the need for public-private partnerships to accelerate development
- Identifies near-Earth asteroids as the most accessible initial targets
- Proposes leveraging NASA scientific missions for resource characterization data
- Addresses policy and regulatory frameworks needed to support commercial activities

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This whitepaper provides a strategic framework for the technology development needed in Phase 0 and the transition to Phase 1:

**Technology Roadmap**: The paper outlines a practical sequence of technology demonstrations needed before full-scale asteroid mining. For Project Dyson, this informs the phasing of capability development, starting with prospecting and progressing through extraction to large-scale processing.

**Knowledge Gap Prioritization**: By identifying the most critical unknowns, the paper helps prioritize research investments. For megastructure construction, understanding which gaps most affect feasibility enables focused technology development.

**Public-Private Synergy**: The collaborative model proposed - where scientific missions contribute to commercial objectives and vice versa - is directly applicable to Project Dyson's approach of synthesizing multiple stakeholder inputs.

**Near-Term Targets**: The focus on near-Earth asteroids provides a practical starting point for resource extraction before expanding to main belt operations. Early Dyson swarm construction could leverage NEA resources before scaling to larger sources.

**Propellant Production Priority**: The emphasis on water extraction for propellant production aligns with the need for space-based logistics infrastructure to support large-scale construction activities.

**Decadal Timeline**: The paper's focus on achievable progress within a decade provides realistic expectations for when asteroid resources could become available for megastructure construction.
