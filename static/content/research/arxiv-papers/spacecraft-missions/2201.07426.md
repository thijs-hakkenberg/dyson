# Small Satellite Mission Concepts for Space Weather Research and as Pathfinders for Operations

## Abstract

This paper explores how miniaturized satellite technology and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) subsystems have made small satellites viable for space weather applications. Drawing from a 2017 international workshop, the authors discuss measurement gaps identified by the World Meteorological Organization and demonstrate how small satellites can address these needs. The paper reviews existing missions and proposed concepts while identifying remaining technical challenges and outlining how strategic funding could enhance both research capabilities and operational forecasting through reduced costs and novel measurement approaches.

## Key Findings

- **Cost reduction**: Small satellites dramatically reduce per-mission costs, enabling constellation deployments previously economically infeasible
- **COTS viability**: Commercial components have matured to support reliable space weather instrumentation
- **Measurement gaps**: WMO-identified gaps in solar wind, magnetospheric, and ionospheric monitoring can be addressed by distributed small satellite networks
- **Pathfinder role**: Small satellites serve as technology demonstrators, reducing risk for larger operational systems
- **Constellation advantages**: Multiple small spacecraft can provide temporal and spatial coverage impossible with single large satellites

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides critical insights for Phase 0 infrastructure development:

1. **Distributed monitoring**: The Dyson swarm will require extensive space weather monitoring to protect both construction assets and completed collector units. Small satellite constellations offer a cost-effective approach.

2. **Solar proximity operations**: Understanding solar activity is essential for spacecraft operating near the Sun. The measurement concepts discussed inform sensor requirements for Phase 1+ operations.

3. **Cost-effective redundancy**: The small satellite paradigm aligns with Project Dyson's need for highly redundant, mass-produced systems rather than expensive one-off spacecraft.

4. **Technology maturation pathway**: Using small satellites as pathfinders before full-scale deployment matches the phased development approach of the Dyson project.

5. **Space weather risk mitigation**: CME detection and prediction capabilities are critical for protecting the trillion-dollar investment in swarm infrastructure.
