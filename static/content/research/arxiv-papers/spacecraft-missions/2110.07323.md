# Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Approach to Integrated Space Mission Planning and Spacecraft Design

## Abstract

This paper addresses the challenge of simultaneously optimizing space mission planning and spacecraft design, which together form a large-scale Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem. The authors propose solving this by decomposing the problem into coupled subproblems using an augmented Lagrangian coordination method. The approach separates the problem into a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) component for mission planning and Nonlinear Programming (NLP) components for spacecraft design. The case study demonstrates optimization of a human lunar exploration mission sequence with improved solutions and reduced computation time compared to existing methods.

## Key Findings

- **Decomposition methodology**: Complex mission planning + spacecraft design problems can be effectively decomposed into tractable subproblems using augmented Lagrangian coordination
- **Hybrid optimization**: Combining MIQP for discrete mission decisions with NLP for continuous spacecraft parameters enables handling of mixed-integer nonlinear problems
- **Computational efficiency**: The proposed method achieves better solutions with reduced computation time compared to monolithic approaches
- **Scalability**: The decomposition framework scales to complex multi-phase missions with coupled vehicle design constraints

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper is highly relevant to Phase 0 planning activities for Project Dyson:

1. **Mission sequencing**: The Dyson swarm construction will require careful sequencing of thousands of missions over decades. This decomposition approach could optimize deployment schedules while accounting for spacecraft design constraints.

2. **Fleet optimization**: Project Dyson will need diverse spacecraft types (collectors, transporters, assembly units). This methodology could co-optimize fleet composition with mission timing.

3. **Resource allocation**: The augmented Lagrangian approach for coupling subproblems is directly applicable to coordinating ISRU production schedules with launch manifests.

4. **Scalability concerns**: While the case study focuses on lunar missions, the decomposition principles could extend to the much larger scale of swarm construction planning.

5. **Design-mission coupling**: Collector unit specifications, transport vehicle capacity, and assembly schedules are tightly coupled - this framework addresses exactly this type of interdependency.
