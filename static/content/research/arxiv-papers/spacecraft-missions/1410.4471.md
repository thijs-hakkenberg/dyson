# Global Asteroid Risk Analysis

## Abstract

This research examines potentially hazardous asteroids and their collision dangers to Earth using the ARMOR (Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research) tool. The study employs the Line of Variation technique to identify virtual impactors based on NASA's Near Earth Object risk list. Key findings indicate that asteroid impacts represent a worldwide threat with distribution across Earth's surface. The author combines impact probability data with population statistics to evaluate global risk levels and proposes ARMOR's potential application as a resource for decision-making in asteroid threat response scenarios.

## Key Findings

- **Global threat distribution**: Asteroid impact risk is distributed worldwide, not concentrated in specific regions
- **Virtual impactor methodology**: Line of Variation technique enables systematic identification of potential collision trajectories
- **Risk quantification**: Combining impact probability with population exposure creates actionable risk metrics
- **Decision support**: ARMOR tool framework supports evidence-based mitigation planning
- **Award-winning approach**: Paper won the 2014 IAC/SGAC Move an Asteroid competition, validating methodology rigor

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides dual relevance - both risk and opportunity:

1. **Asteroid resource targeting**: The same methodology that identifies hazardous asteroids can prioritize ISRU targets. Near-Earth asteroids on well-characterized orbits are both the easiest to reach and best understood.

2. **Risk to Earth infrastructure**: Project Dyson's Earth-based facilities (launch sites, control centers, manufacturing) face asteroid impact risk that should be included in site selection criteria.

3. **Planetary defense synergy**: A mature Dyson swarm could potentially contribute to planetary defense through debris interception or orbit modification - dual-use capability worth considering.

4. **Orbital mechanics expertise**: The trajectory analysis techniques for impact prediction directly apply to mission planning for asteroid mining operations.

5. **Decision framework**: The ARMOR risk quantification approach could be adapted for prioritizing which asteroids to target for ISRU operations based on accessibility and resource value.

6. **Cataloging requirements**: Understanding asteroid populations informs how much survey work Phase 0 should include for resource mapping.
