# Optical communication on CubeSats - Enabling the next era in space science

## Abstract

This paper addresses how laser communication (lasercom) technology can overcome RF spectrum limitations for CubeSat data transmission. The authors present findings from Keck Institute for Space Studies workshops that examined three scenarios: low Earth orbit operations, satellite crosslinks, and deep space missions. Their work demonstrates that lasercom systems could dramatically enhance transmission capacity while maintaining compact spacecraft footprints and minimal power requirements, positioning optical systems as viable alternatives to conventional radio frequency communications for high-bandwidth applications.

## Key Findings

- **Bandwidth advantage**: Optical communication provides orders of magnitude higher data rates than RF systems of comparable size/power
- **Spectrum availability**: Laser frequencies avoid the increasingly congested RF spectrum
- **Miniaturization feasible**: Lasercom terminals can be packaged within CubeSat form factors
- **Three operational domains**: LEO-to-ground, inter-satellite crosslinks, and deep space each have distinct requirements and solutions
- **Power efficiency**: Optical systems achieve higher bits-per-watt than RF alternatives for equivalent link distances

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper is directly applicable to Phase 1 communications architecture:

1. **Swarm coordination**: Millions of collector units will need to communicate status, position, and operational data. Optical crosslinks offer the bandwidth for constellation-scale coordination without RF interference.

2. **Power budget efficiency**: For spacecraft where every watt matters for collection efficiency, optical communication's superior power efficiency is critical.

3. **Deep space applicability**: The analysis of deep space lasercom informs communication between the inner solar system swarm and Earth-based operations centers.

4. **Scalability**: RF spectrum would be overwhelmed by millions of transmitting units; optical communication's directional nature enables spatial multiplexing.

5. **Data architecture**: High-bandwidth optical links enable more sophisticated distributed computing across the swarm, supporting autonomous operations.

6. **Technology readiness**: This 2018 paper represents technology that will have matured significantly by Phase 1 deployment, reducing development risk.
