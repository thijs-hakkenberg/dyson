# 21st Century Planar Field Emission Theory and its Role in Vacuum Breakdown Science

## Abstract

For explaining electrical breakdown, field electron emission (FE) is a mechanism of interest. In the period 2006 to 2010 there were significant developments in basic FE theory, but these have not yet fully entered general thinking in technological FE areas, which are often still based on 1960s thinking. This paper reviews modern field emission theory and its application to understanding vacuum breakdown phenomena, providing updated models for predicting breakdown thresholds in high-voltage vacuum systems.

## Key Findings

- Modern field emission theory differs significantly from classical 1960s models
- Surface geometry and work function variations critically affect breakdown thresholds
- Nanoscale surface features can dramatically lower breakdown voltages
- Temperature effects on field emission are more complex than previously understood
- Pre-breakdown conditioning can improve voltage holdoff capability
- Material selection and surface preparation are key to high-voltage performance

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper addresses fundamental physics relevant to research questions rq-1-4 and rq-1-8 on high-voltage systems in space:

1. **Research Question rq-1-4 (High Voltage Plasma Breakdown)**: Understanding field emission mechanisms is essential for designing high-voltage power transmission and processing systems that must operate reliably in the space environment.

2. **Research Question rq-1-8 (Thin Film High Voltage)**: Thin-film conductors and insulators on collector units must withstand voltage stresses without breakdown. This paper provides theoretical foundations for predicting breakdown limits.

3. **Power Transmission Systems**: High-voltage DC transmission between swarm elements requires understanding breakdown mechanisms to ensure reliable operation over mission lifetimes.

4. **Material Selection**: The relationship between surface properties and breakdown threshold guides material selection for high-voltage components.

5. **Surface Preparation**: Conditioning and surface treatment protocols can improve voltage holdoff, informing manufacturing specifications.

6. **Design Margins**: Updated breakdown models enable more accurate safety factor calculations for high-voltage system design.
