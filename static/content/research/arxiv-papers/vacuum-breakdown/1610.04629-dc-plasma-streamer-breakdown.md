# DC high voltage to drive helium plasma jet comprised of repetitive streamer breakdowns

## Abstract

This paper demonstrates and studies helium atmospheric pressure plasma jet comprised of series of repetitive streamer breakdowns, which is driven by a pure DC high voltage (auto-oscillations). Repetition frequency of the breakdowns is governed by the geometry of discharge electrodes/surroundings and the properties of the external circuit. The study provides insights into breakdown initiation, propagation, and the transition from pre-breakdown to sustained discharge conditions.

## Key Findings

- DC high voltage can drive repetitive plasma breakdown events
- Breakdown frequency depends on electrode geometry and circuit parameters
- Streamer propagation dynamics characterized experimentally
- Auto-oscillation behavior observed without external pulsing
- Gap spacing and gas composition affect breakdown characteristics
- Results applicable to understanding unwanted breakdown in high-voltage systems

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides experimental data on breakdown phenomena relevant to research questions rq-1-4 and rq-1-8:

1. **Research Question rq-1-4 (High Voltage Plasma Breakdown)**: Understanding how breakdowns initiate and propagate helps design systems that avoid unintended discharges in space-based high-voltage equipment.

2. **Research Question rq-1-8 (Thin Film High Voltage)**: While focused on gas-phase breakdown, the streamer physics informs understanding of surface flashover and vacuum breakdown precursors.

3. **Spacecraft Charging**: Repetitive breakdown behavior relates to spacecraft charging and discharge phenomena that can damage sensitive electronics.

4. **Electric Propulsion Interface**: High-voltage interfaces between power systems and electric thrusters must avoid unintended breakdown. This paper provides design guidance.

5. **Diagnostic Development**: The experimental techniques used to characterize breakdown could be adapted for in-situ monitoring of high-voltage system health.

6. **Failure Mode Analysis**: Understanding breakdown progression helps design fault protection systems for high-voltage equipment.
