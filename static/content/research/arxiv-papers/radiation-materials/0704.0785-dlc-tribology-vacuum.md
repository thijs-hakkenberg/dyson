# Viscoplastic Properties and Tribological Behavior of Diamond-Like Carbon Films Using Nanoindentation and Nanoscratch Tests

## Abstract

Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) films have been shown to demonstrate various tribological behaviors: in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), with either friction coefficients as low as 0.01 or less and very mild wear, or very high friction coefficients (>0.4) and drastic wear. These behaviors depend notably on gaseous environment, hydrogen content, and surface chemistry. This study characterizes the mechanical and tribological properties of DLC films through nanoindentation and nanoscratch testing, providing data relevant to space mechanism applications.

## Key Findings

- DLC films exhibit dramatically different friction behavior in UHV vs ambient conditions
- Hydrogen content in DLC films strongly affects vacuum tribological performance
- Ultra-low friction (<0.01) achievable with proper film composition
- Some compositions show catastrophic wear in vacuum
- Nanoindentation reveals viscoplastic deformation characteristics
- Surface chemistry and passivation critical for vacuum performance

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper addresses tribology in vacuum directly relevant to research question rq-2-11:

1. **Research Question rq-2-11 (Cold Welding in Space Mechanisms)**: DLC coatings can prevent cold welding and reduce friction in vacuum. Understanding which compositions work in UHV informs coating selection for space mechanisms.

2. **Mechanism Lubrication**: Conventional lubricants fail in vacuum. DLC films provide solid lubrication for bearings, gears, and sliding contacts.

3. **Coating Selection**: The dramatic variation in performance with hydrogen content and environment guides coating specification for space hardware.

4. **Wear Prevention**: Mechanisms must operate reliably over mission lifetimes. Understanding wear mechanisms enables lifetime prediction.

5. **Surface Treatment**: DLC can be applied to various substrates, enabling tribological improvement of existing mechanism designs.

6. **Testing Protocols**: The characterization methods provide approaches for qualifying coatings for space applications.
