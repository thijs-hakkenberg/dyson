# A non-resonant dielectric metamaterial for enhancement of thin-film solar cells

## Abstract

Recently, we have suggested dielectric metamaterial composed as an array of submicron dielectric spheres located on top of an amorphous thin-film solar cell. We have theoretically shown that this metamaterial can decrease the reflection and simultaneously can suppress the transmission through the photovoltaic layer by converting incident plane waves into focused light beams. This experimental study extends prior theoretical work to oblique illumination angles and demonstrates that the omnidirectional light-trapping structure may operate better than the optimized flat coating obtained by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.

## Key Findings

- Submicron dielectric sphere arrays can simultaneously reduce reflection and enhance absorption
- Light focusing effect converts plane waves into concentrated beams within the photovoltaic layer
- Omnidirectional performance maintained across oblique incidence angles
- Metamaterial coating outperforms conventional PECVD anti-reflection coatings
- Non-resonant design provides broadband enhancement across solar spectrum
- Applicable to thin-film amorphous silicon solar cells

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper offers design insights for Phase 1 collector unit optimization:

1. **Mass Reduction**: Thin-film solar cells are essential for the Dyson swarm due to the extreme mass constraints. Any technology that improves thin-film efficiency directly impacts the swarm's energy output per unit mass.

2. **Omnidirectional Collection**: Collector units in the swarm will experience varying illumination angles due to orbital dynamics and attitude variations. Omnidirectional light trapping reduces sensitivity to pointing accuracy.

3. **Efficiency Enhancement**: Improving absorption in thin active layers addresses one of the main limitations of lightweight photovoltaics. Higher efficiency means fewer collector units needed for the same power output.

4. **Passive Technology**: Dielectric metamaterial coatings are passive structures requiring no active control, important for the reliability of billions of distributed units.

5. **Radiation Tolerance Potential**: Dielectric materials may offer better radiation tolerance than metallic alternatives, though this requires further investigation for space applications.

6. **Manufacturing Considerations**: Submicron sphere arrays represent a manufacturing challenge at scale but could potentially be self-assembled or printed.
