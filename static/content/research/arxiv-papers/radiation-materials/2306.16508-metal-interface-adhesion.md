# Effects of surface chemical modifications on the adhesion of metallic interfaces: A high-throughput analysis

## Abstract

Chemical interactions between two surfaces in contact play a crucial role in determining the mechanical and tribological behavior of solid interfaces. These interactions can be quantified via adhesion energy, that is a measure of the strength by which two surfaces bind together. This work presents a high-throughput computational analysis of how surface chemical modifications affect adhesion between metallic surfaces, providing guidance for preventing unwanted bonding in vacuum environments.

## Key Findings

- Surface chemistry dramatically affects metal-metal adhesion energy
- Oxide layers and adsorbates can reduce or enhance adhesion
- Computational screening identifies surface treatments that minimize adhesion
- Clean metal surfaces in vacuum exhibit strong adhesion (cold welding)
- Passivation strategies can prevent unwanted bonding
- Results applicable to mechanism design for space applications

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides computational guidance for research question rq-2-11:

1. **Research Question rq-2-11 (Cold Welding Prevention)**: Understanding how surface chemistry affects adhesion enables design of surface treatments that prevent cold welding in space mechanisms.

2. **Passivation Strategies**: The high-throughput analysis identifies effective passivation approaches for various metal combinations relevant to space hardware.

3. **Material Selection**: Adhesion data guides selection of material pairs for bearing, gear, and fastener applications.

4. **Manufacturing Specifications**: Results inform surface preparation and handling requirements during component fabrication.

5. **Mechanism Design**: Understanding adhesion mechanisms enables design of mechanisms that avoid problematic material contacts.

6. **Computational Screening**: The methodology demonstrates efficient computational approaches for screening surface treatment options.
