# Enhanced Photovoltaic Performances of Graphene/Si Solar Cells by Insertion of an MoS2 Thin Film

## Abstract

Atomically thin layered materials such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides exhibit great potential as active materials in optoelectronic devices because of their high carrier-transporting properties and strong light-matter interactions. Here, we demonstrated that the photovoltaic performance of graphene/silicon Schottky junction solar cells achieves significantly improved energy conversion when a molybdenum disulfide layer is added. The MoS2 interlayer functions as an effective passivation and electron-blocking/hole-transporting layer. The study reveals performance gains correlate with increased graphene stacking and reduced MoS2 thickness. The optimized configuration of trilayer graphene combined with the transition-metal dichalcogenide and n-type silicon achieved a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 11.1%.

## Key Findings

- MoS2 interlayer provides effective passivation of the graphene/Si interface
- MoS2 acts as electron-blocking and hole-transporting layer
- Trilayer graphene outperforms monolayer and bilayer configurations
- Thinner MoS2 layers provide better performance
- Optimized structure achieved 11.1% conversion efficiency
- 2D material heterostructures offer tunable interface engineering

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper explores advanced materials relevant to Phase 2 collector technology evolution:

1. **Ultra-Lightweight Materials**: Graphene and 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides represent the ultimate limit in thin-film technology. Atomically thin active layers could dramatically reduce collector unit mass.

2. **Interface Engineering**: The passivation and carrier-selective transport functions of MoS2 demonstrate how 2D material interfaces can be engineered for specific electronic functions without bulk material.

3. **Radiation Tolerance Potential**: 2D materials have unique defect properties that may offer advantages in radiation environments. Defects in 2D materials can sometimes be self-healing or have less impact on overall performance.

4. **Manufacturing Pathway**: While current 2D material production is limited, techniques like chemical vapor deposition and liquid-phase exfoliation are advancing toward scalable manufacturing.

5. **Efficiency Trajectory**: The 11.1% efficiency demonstrated is competitive for a novel architecture, and continued development could reach efficiencies suitable for space applications.

6. **Flexible Substrates**: 2D material solar cells are inherently compatible with flexible substrates, enabling deployable and rollable collector designs.
