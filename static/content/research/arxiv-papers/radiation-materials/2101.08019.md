# UMG silicon for solar PV: from defects detection to PV module degradation

## Abstract

Upgraded metallurgical grade silicon (UMG-Si) for photovoltaic (PV) solar applications has been manufactured through the metallurgical route by means of the process developed by Ferrosolar. In an ambitious mass production test, performed in commercial solar cells and modules production lines, the silicon was proven to be appropriate for photovoltaics applications, reaching, in a conventional production line, up to 20.76% of solar cell efficiency with multicrystalline cells. Key findings include defect engineering improvements to bulk lifetime, outdoor field testing comparing UMG silicon modules with polysilicon modules over 24 months showing equivalent degradation rates, and a comprehensive life cycle assessment. The researchers conclude that chemical analysis, defect characterization, and environmental evaluation confirm its potential to be used as raw material for PV applications.

## Key Findings

- UMG-Si achieved 20.76% efficiency in conventional multicrystalline production lines
- 24-month field testing showed equivalent degradation rates compared to standard polysilicon modules
- Defect engineering techniques can improve bulk carrier lifetime in UMG material
- Metallurgical processing route offers potential cost and environmental advantages
- Life cycle assessment confirms viability as PV raw material
- Defect detection methods enable quality control for mass production

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper is relevant to Phase 2 scaling of collector unit production:

1. **Mass Production Scalability**: The Dyson swarm requires manufacturing solar cells at unprecedented scale. UMG-Si offers a potentially more scalable production pathway than traditional polysilicon refining.

2. **Material Availability**: Metallurgical grade silicon is more abundant and accessible than semiconductor-grade silicon. For building millions or billions of collector units, material sourcing is a critical constraint.

3. **Degradation Equivalence**: The finding that UMG-Si modules degrade at equivalent rates to standard polysilicon validates that lower-purity starting material does not compromise long-term performance.

4. **Defect Engineering**: The demonstrated ability to improve material quality through defect engineering provides a pathway for continuous improvement of space-grade cells.

5. **Environmental Considerations**: While environmental impact on Earth is less critical for space-based applications, the manufacturing infrastructure will likely be Earth-based initially, making lifecycle considerations relevant.

6. **Cost Reduction**: Lower material costs enable faster deployment and iteration during the construction phase.
