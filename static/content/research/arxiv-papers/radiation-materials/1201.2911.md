# Analytical Model for the Optical Functions of Indium Gallium Nitride with Application to Thin Film Solar Photovoltaic Cells

## Abstract

This paper presents the preliminary results of optical characterization using spectroscopic ellipsometry of wurtzite indium gallium nitride (InxGa1-xN) thin films with medium indium content (0.38 < x < 0.68) that were deposited on silicon dioxide using plasma-enhanced evaporation. A Kramers-Kronig consistent model incorporating Gaussian oscillators was developed to characterize absorption behavior and determine dielectric function components. Electron microscopy examination verified structural properties and thickness measurements obtained from ellipsometry analysis. The methodology and derived parameters provide a framework for extracting physical characteristics from comparable InxGa1-xN film measurements in subsequent investigations.

## Key Findings

- Kramers-Kronig consistent optical model developed for medium-indium InGaN alloys
- Gaussian oscillator model accurately represents absorption characteristics
- Spectroscopic ellipsometry enables non-destructive characterization
- Wurtzite crystal structure verified via electron microscopy
- Plasma-enhanced evaporation viable for InGaN thin film deposition
- Bandgap tunability across visible spectrum with indium content variation

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides foundational optical data for Phase 1 collector material selection:

1. **Bandgap Engineering**: InGaN offers continuous bandgap tunability from 0.7 eV (InN) to 3.4 eV (GaN), enabling optimization for the solar spectrum at different heliocentric distances.

2. **Radiation Hardness**: III-V nitride semiconductors are known for exceptional radiation tolerance compared to silicon and conventional III-V arsenides/phosphides. This is critical for long-duration space operation.

3. **High-Temperature Operation**: GaN and InGaN materials maintain performance at elevated temperatures, relevant for collector units operating closer to the Sun.

4. **Thin-Film Compatibility**: The demonstrated plasma-enhanced deposition on oxide substrates indicates compatibility with thin-film manufacturing approaches needed for lightweight collectors.

5. **Optical Design**: Accurate optical function models are essential for designing anti-reflection coatings, back reflectors, and multi-junction cell architectures.

6. **Material System Maturity**: InGaN is already used in commercial LEDs and power electronics, providing a manufacturing base that could be adapted for photovoltaic production.
