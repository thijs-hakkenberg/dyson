# Radiation hardness and post irradiation regeneration behavior of GaInAsP solar cells

## Abstract

Recent developments have renewed the demand for solar cells with increased tolerance to radiation damage. To investigate the specific irradiation damage of 1 MeV electron irradiation in GaInAsP lattice matched to InP for varying In and P contents, a simulation based analysis is employed. Testing also explored healing effects under simulated satellite conditions (60C with AM0 lighting). Results demonstrated that the irradiation induced defect recombination coefficient for irradiation with 1 MeV electrons after regeneration for 216 hours can be described with a linear function of InP-fraction. The findings suggest GaInAsP represents a viable candidate material for radiation-resistant space-based photovoltaic systems.

## Key Findings

- GaInAsP materials show measurable radiation hardness characteristics under 1 MeV electron irradiation
- Post-irradiation regeneration (self-healing) occurs under simulated satellite thermal and illumination conditions
- Defect recombination behavior correlates linearly with InP content fraction
- 216-hour regeneration period demonstrates significant recovery of performance
- Material composition can be optimized for radiation tolerance in space environments

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper is highly relevant to Phase 1 collector unit design for the following reasons:

1. **Long-term Durability**: The Dyson swarm will operate for decades to centuries in the inner solar system where radiation flux is intense. Understanding radiation hardness and self-healing mechanisms is critical for material selection.

2. **Material Selection**: GaInAsP as a III-V semiconductor material offers tunable bandgap and radiation tolerance, making it a candidate for space-based photovoltaic applications in the swarm.

3. **Degradation Mitigation**: The demonstrated post-irradiation regeneration behavior suggests that operating temperatures and illumination conditions in the inner solar system may actually promote self-healing of radiation damage.

4. **Design Optimization**: The linear relationship between InP fraction and radiation tolerance provides a design parameter for optimizing collector unit photovoltaic materials.

5. **Maintenance Reduction**: Self-healing materials reduce the need for replacement or repair of degraded collector units, critical for a megastructure with billions of components.
