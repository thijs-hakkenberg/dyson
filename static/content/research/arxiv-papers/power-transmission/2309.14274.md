# Analysis and Experimental Validation of the WPT Efficiency of the Both-Sides Retrodirective System

## Abstract

The retrodirective antenna array is considered as a mechanism to enable target tracking of a power receiver for long range wireless power transfer (WPT) due to its simplicity in implementation using only analog circuits. By installing the retrodirective capability on both the generator and rectenna sides, the system achieves automatic beam alignment without complex digital processing or mechanical steering. This paper presents analysis and experimental validation of WPT efficiency for such both-sides retrodirective systems.

## Key Findings

- **Dual Retrodirective Architecture**: Installing retrodirective capability on both transmitter and receiver enables automatic mutual beam alignment
- **Analog Implementation**: System achieves beam steering using only analog circuits, avoiding complex digital signal processing overhead
- **Experimental Validation**: Laboratory experiments confirm theoretical efficiency predictions for the retrodirective WPT system
- **Target Tracking**: The retrodirective approach inherently tracks moving receivers, critical for dynamic space-based applications
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Quantifies actual WPT efficiency under various alignment conditions and distances

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper directly addresses beam steering challenges critical to Phase 2 power transmission:

1. **Space-to-Space Power Transfer**: Retrodirective systems are ideal for power beaming between orbital elements of the Dyson swarm, where both transmitter and receiver positions change continuously
2. **Reduced Computational Overhead**: The analog retrodirective approach eliminates need for complex tracking algorithms, reducing computational burden on space-based systems
3. **Automatic Alignment**: Both-sides retrodirective capability ensures automatic beam alignment even as solar collectors orbit the Sun and receiving stations orbit Earth
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Analog implementation provides inherent reliability advantages over digital beam steering systems in the radiation environment of space
5. **Scalability for Phased Arrays**: The retrodirective principle scales to the large phased arrays (potentially kilometers in diameter) needed for GW-scale power transmission

**Key Consideration for Dyson Application**: The paper validates retrodirective systems at laboratory scales. Scaling to the 10+ km transmitting apertures required for efficient interplanetary power beaming introduces additional challenges in phase coherence across the array and thermal stability.
