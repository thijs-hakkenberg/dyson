# Fundamentals of Wireless Information and Power Transfer: From RF Energy Harvester Models to Signal and System Designs

## Abstract

Radio waves carry both energy and information simultaneously. Nevertheless, Radio-Frequency (RF) transmission of these quantities have traditionally been treated separately. Currently, we are experiencing a paradigm shift in wireless network design, namely unifying wireless transmission of information and power. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of wireless information and power transfer (WIPT), covering RF energy harvester models, signal designs, and system architectures.

## Key Findings

- **Nonlinear Energy Harvester Models**: The paper establishes that RF-to-DC conversion efficiency is inherently nonlinear, depending on input power levels, waveform characteristics, and rectifier design
- **Unified Framework**: Provides theoretical foundations for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems
- **Waveform Optimization**: Demonstrates that multi-sine waveforms can significantly improve energy harvesting efficiency compared to single-tone signals
- **System Architecture Trade-offs**: Analyzes time-switching vs. power-splitting receiver architectures for SWIPT
- **Efficiency Bounds**: Establishes theoretical efficiency limits for RF energy harvesting under various operating conditions

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This foundational paper is highly relevant to Phase 2 power transmission infrastructure:

1. **Rectenna Design Principles**: The nonlinear harvester models directly inform the design of space-based and ground-based rectennas for microwave power transmission
2. **Efficiency Optimization**: Understanding RF-to-DC conversion nonlinearities is critical for maximizing end-to-end efficiency in the 150 million km transmission path from solar collectors to Earth
3. **Waveform Design**: Multi-sine waveform optimization techniques could improve power beaming efficiency, particularly for atmospheric penetration
4. **System Architecture**: The unified WIPT framework provides theoretical grounding for hybrid communication/power transmission systems needed for Dyson swarm coordination
5. **Scaling Considerations**: While focused on near-field applications, the fundamental efficiency models scale to space-based power transmission with appropriate modifications for beam divergence and atmospheric losses

**Limitations for Space Application**: The paper focuses primarily on near-field and terrestrial applications. Space-to-Earth transmission at GW scale introduces additional challenges including ionospheric effects, beam pointing accuracy, and thermal management not addressed in this work.
