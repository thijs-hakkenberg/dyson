# A C-band microwave rectifier without capacitors for microwave power transmission

## Abstract

A microwave rectifier at 5.8 GHz without any capacitors is presented, which owns a measured MW-to-DC conversion efficiency of 68.1%. A harmonic rejection filter and a DC pass filter, which replace lumped capacitors in conventional microwave rectifiers, are applied to suppressing the harmonics produced by the rectifying diode and extracting the DC component. This capacitorless design improves reliability and thermal performance for high-power applications.

## Key Findings

- **68.1% Conversion Efficiency**: Achieved microwave-to-DC conversion efficiency of 68.1% at 5.8 GHz C-band frequency
- **Capacitorless Design**: Eliminates lumped capacitors, replacing them with distributed filter structures
- **Harmonic Rejection Filter**: Suppresses harmonics generated by rectifying diode without capacitive elements
- **DC Pass Filter**: Extracts DC component using filter topology rather than traditional capacitor smoothing
- **Improved Reliability**: Removing capacitors eliminates a common failure mode in high-power rectifiers
- **Thermal Performance**: Capacitorless design improves thermal characteristics for sustained high-power operation

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This recent paper addresses critical rectenna design challenges for Phase 2:

1. **High-Power Rectification**: The capacitorless design is specifically intended for microwave power transmission applications, directly applicable to Dyson swarm power beaming
2. **Reliability in Space**: Eliminating capacitors removes components prone to degradation in the space radiation environment and thermal cycling
3. **5.8 GHz Operating Frequency**: C-band (5.8 GHz) is a candidate frequency for space-to-Earth power transmission due to favorable atmospheric transmission characteristics
4. **Scalable Efficiency**: 68.1% rectification efficiency, while demonstrated at laboratory scale, provides baseline for GW-scale rectenna farm efficiency projections
5. **Thermal Management**: Improved thermal performance is critical for the concentrated power densities expected at rectenna receiving stations

**Efficiency Analysis for Dyson Application**:
- Assuming 68% rectification efficiency
- Combined with ~90% atmospheric transmission at 5.8 GHz
- And ~85% DC-AC conversion efficiency
- End-to-end efficiency from microwave beam to grid power: ~52%

This aligns with Phase 2 efficiency targets but highlights the need for continued rectifier development to improve overall system efficiency.
