# Online Power Control Optimization for Wireless Transmission with Energy Harvesting and Storage

## Abstract

We consider wireless transmission over fading channel powered by energy harvesting and storage devices. Assuming a finite battery storage capacity, we design an online power control strategy aiming at maximizing the long-term time-averaged transmission rate under battery operational constraints for energy harvesting systems. The paper develops optimal and near-optimal algorithms for power allocation that adapt to channel conditions and energy availability in real-time.

## Key Findings

- **Online Optimization Framework**: Develops real-time power control algorithms that don't require future knowledge of energy availability or channel conditions
- **Finite Battery Constraints**: Addresses practical limitations of finite energy storage capacity in system optimization
- **Long-term Rate Maximization**: Optimizes for sustained average transmission rate rather than instantaneous performance
- **Adaptive Power Allocation**: Algorithms adapt transmission power based on current battery state and channel fading
- **Provable Performance Bounds**: Establishes theoretical guarantees on algorithm performance relative to optimal offline solutions

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper addresses power management challenges relevant to Phase 2 operations:

1. **Variable Solar Input**: Solar collectors in the Dyson swarm experience variable power generation due to orbital dynamics, eclipse periods, and solar activity - analogous to the energy harvesting variability addressed in this paper
2. **Energy Storage Optimization**: The finite battery constraint model applies to buffer storage systems that smooth power transmission despite variable generation
3. **Real-time Control**: Online algorithms that don't require perfect forecasting are essential for autonomous operation of distributed swarm elements
4. **Transmission Scheduling**: Power control optimization directly informs scheduling of power beaming to Earth-based or space-based receivers during varying conditions
5. **Fading Channel Model**: While developed for RF fading, the mathematical framework extends to modeling atmospheric effects on microwave power transmission

**Application to Dyson Swarm Operations**:
- Individual collector units generate variable power based on solar orientation
- Power must be transmitted to relay stations or directly to Earth
- Energy buffering at collectors and relay stations requires optimal charge/discharge strategies
- The online optimization approach enables autonomous distributed control without centralized coordination

**Scaling Considerations**: The paper addresses single-link optimization. Dyson swarm power management requires extending these techniques to mesh networks with multiple sources, relays, and destinations.
