## Abstract

New field-emission rising-sun magnetron design at 2.45 GHz achieved >100 kW output at >85% DC-to-microwave efficiency in simulation. Significant improvement over conventional magnetrons (~54% efficiency).

## Key Findings

- >85% DC-to-microwave efficiency at >100kW
- Rising-sun magnetron design
- Could reduce MPT subsystem cost by ~30%
- 2.45 GHz frequency

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Directly improves the DC-to-RF link in rq-2-23 efficiency chain from ~54% to >85%. This is one of the largest single-stage efficiency improvements available in the microwave power transmission chain, potentially transforming the economics of space-to-ground power beaming.
