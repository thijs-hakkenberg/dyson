## Abstract

JAXA research on retrodirective beam control achieving 0.001-degree pointing accuracy from GEO using software-based pilot signal tracking and REV method.

## Key Findings

- 0.001-degree pointing accuracy from GEO
- REV method for phase control
- Software-based pilot signal tracking
- Addresses GEO-to-ground beam alignment

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Addresses retrodirective phase coherence aspect of rq-2-23. The demonstrated pointing accuracy from GEO distance is directly applicable to the Dyson swarm power transmission architecture, where precise beam steering to ground rectennas is essential for both efficiency and safety.
