## Abstract

Efficiency analysis framework for microwave WPT from thin-film space solar power satellite. Addresses thin-film specific considerations for power transmission.

## Key Findings

- Framework for thin-film SSPS WPT analysis
- Addresses membrane-specific power conversion challenges

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Applicable to thin-film collector architecture in Phase 2 rq-2-23. The thin-film specific considerations are directly relevant since Project Dyson's collector units use lightweight membrane-based solar cells rather than rigid panel arrays.
