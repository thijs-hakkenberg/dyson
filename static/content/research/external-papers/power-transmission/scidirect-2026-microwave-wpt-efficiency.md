## Abstract

Introduces aperture-to-distance ratio as critical optimization parameter for microwave WPT. Analyzes efficiency chain for space-to-ground power transmission.

## Key Findings

- Aperture-to-distance ratio is critical parameter for WPT optimization
- Rectenna efficiency >95% demonstrated in lab
- ~50% practical end-to-end efficiency consensus

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Provides updated efficiency framework for rq-2-23 analysis. The aperture-to-distance ratio formulation is particularly useful for sizing the transmit and receive arrays as a function of orbital altitude.
