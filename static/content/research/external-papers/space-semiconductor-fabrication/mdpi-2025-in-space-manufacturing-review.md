## Abstract

Comprehensive review of in-space manufacturing technologies. Notes ISRU-to-semiconductor remains early stage but additive manufacturing and EHD printing offer realistic near-term pathways.

## Key Findings

- AM and EHD printing are realistic near-term pathways for space manufacturing
- ISRU-to-semiconductor still early stage
- Comprehensive technology assessment across manufacturing modalities

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Provides technology landscape context for rq-0-44 semiconductor fabrication feasibility. Useful for understanding which manufacturing approaches are most mature and which require the most development investment.
