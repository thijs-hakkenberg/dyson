## Abstract

NASA ODME program partnering with Intel, NAU, Fujifilm, TEL, and Axiom Space to develop electrohydrodynamic (EHD) inkjet printing for maskless semiconductor fabrication in microgravity. Flight testing on ISS 2024-2025. Eliminates lithography and etching. Uses native vacuum of space as advantage.

## Key Findings

- EHD inkjet printing eliminates need for lithography
- Maskless fabrication possible in orbit
- ISS flight testing underway 2024-2025
- Uses vacuum as advantage rather than fighting it
- Multiple industry partners: Intel, NAU, Fujifilm, TEL, Axiom Space

## Relevance to Project Dyson

EHD printing is particularly promising for ISRU-based feedstock in rq-0-44 since it is additive and maskless. The elimination of lithographic masks and chemical etching dramatically simplifies the supply chain for orbital semiconductor fabrication, making it more feasible to transition to locally-sourced materials.
