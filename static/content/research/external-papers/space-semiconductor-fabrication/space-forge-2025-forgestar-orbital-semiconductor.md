## Abstract

Space Forge achieved world first generating plasma aboard ForgeStar-1 satellite, confirming gas-phase crystal growth conditions can be created on autonomous orbital platform. Focus materials: GaN, SiC, AlN, diamond. Space-grown semiconductors estimated to enable up to 60% energy reduction in electronic devices.

## Key Findings

- First orbital plasma generation for semiconductor manufacturing
- 1000C furnace operational on autonomous satellite
- GaN/SiC/AlN/diamond targeted as focus materials
- Partnership with United Semiconductors LLC
- Launched June 2025 on SpaceX Transporter-14

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Major milestone for rq-0-44. Moves space semiconductor fabrication from theoretical to demonstrated (TRL 4-5). While ForgeStar-1 uses Earth-sourced feedstock, the demonstrated ability to maintain plasma and high-temperature processing in orbit is a critical enabling technology for eventual ISRU-based semiconductor production.
