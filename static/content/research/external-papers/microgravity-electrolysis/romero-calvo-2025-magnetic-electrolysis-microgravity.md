## Abstract

Demonstrates that commercial neodymium magnets enhance water electrolysis in microgravity with current density improvements of up to 240%. Two mechanisms: diamagnetic buoyancy guides bubbles to collection points; MHD force creates convective flow. PEM electrolyzer and MHD drive prototypes achieved near-terrestrial efficiencies in microgravity.

## Key Findings

- Up to 240% current density improvement using commercial neodymium magnets
- Passive gas-liquid separation with no moving parts
- Two complementary mechanisms: diamagnetic buoyancy + magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) convection
- Near-terrestrial efficiency achieved in microgravity
- Eliminates need for rotary separators in space electrolysis systems

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Directly addresses rq-0-33. Eliminates mechanical separators for ISPP electrolysis, dramatically improving reliability and reducing mass. The passive nature of the magnetic approach (no moving parts, no power beyond permanent magnets for separation) is particularly attractive for long-duration autonomous operation at L4/L5.
