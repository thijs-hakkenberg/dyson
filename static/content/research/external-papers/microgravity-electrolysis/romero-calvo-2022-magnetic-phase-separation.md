## Abstract

Drop tower validation of diamagnetic and paramagnetic separation on multiple liquids. Demonstrates physical basis for magnetic phase separation in reduced gravity environments.

## Key Findings

- Drop tower validated dia- and paramagnetic separation
- Multiple liquid systems demonstrated
- Foundational work for 2025 Nature Chemistry breakthrough

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Provides the experimental foundation for magnetic separation approach to rq-0-33. This earlier work established the physical principles that were later scaled up to full electrolyzer prototypes, confirming that the magnetic approach is grounded in well-characterized physics rather than a single demonstration.
