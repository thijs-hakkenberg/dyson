## Abstract

Comprehensive review of PEM and alkaline electrolyzers in space, covering bubble dynamics, gas-liquid separation challenges, and technology readiness for ISRU applications.

## Key Findings

- Comprehensive review of space electrolysis state of art
- PEM and alkaline systems compared for space applications
- Bubble dynamics in microgravity characterized

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Provides context for all gas-liquid separation approaches relevant to rq-0-33. Establishes the baseline challenges that magnetic separation and other novel approaches must address for reliable propellant production at L4/L5.
