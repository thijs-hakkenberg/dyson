## Abstract

Detailed Thermal Desktop analysis of a cryogenic propellant depot configuration, examining the thermal performance of sunshield-protected LH2 and LOX modules in various orbital environments. Identifies sensitivity to Earth infrared radiation and albedo as the dominant thermal challenge for LEO and near-Earth depots.

## Key Findings

- The LH2 module is particularly sensitive to Earth IR and albedo radiation traversing the open end of the sunshield during orbital illumination periods
- Earth IR and albedo represent the dominant heat sources for cryogenic depots in LEO and cislunar orbits -- more significant than direct solar radiation (which is blocked by the sunshield)
- Thermal Desktop modeling showed that heat ingress through the open end of the sunshield during Earth-facing illumination phases significantly degrades ZBO performance
- The Earth IR/albedo problem largely vanishes at Lagrange points (L4/L5) where the Earth subtends a negligible solid angle
- Tank orientation and sunshield geometry optimization can reduce but not eliminate Earth-facing heat ingress in LEO
- The study quantified heat loads from each source (solar, Earth IR, Earth albedo, internal equipment) to prioritize thermal management investments

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides the strongest quantitative argument for locating cryogenic storage at L4/L5 rather than in LEO or at Earth-Moon L1. The dominant thermal problem identified -- Earth IR and albedo entering the open end of the sunshield -- is essentially eliminated at Sun-Earth L4/L5 where the Earth is approximately 1 AU away and subtends a negligible solid angle. This means the sunshield design at L4/L5 can be significantly simpler (truncated cone rather than full enclosure) and the overall thermal management burden is reduced to blocking only solar radiation from a single predictable direction. The Thermal Desktop methodology used here should be applied to validate the station's specific thermal design.
