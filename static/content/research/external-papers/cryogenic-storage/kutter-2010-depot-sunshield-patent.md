## Abstract

Patent describing an orbital refueling station with a cryogenic tank shielded by a deployable sunshield to mitigate solar radiation and thermal emissions from Earth. The system features a lightweight cylindrical cryogenic tank with integral docking port, equipment deck, and deployable thermal sunshield comprised of reflective panels forming a truncated cone shape. Tank rotation about its longitudinal axis generates centrifugal acceleration for positive gas/liquid separation.

## Key Findings

- **Truncated cone sunshield**: At a Lagrange point where the only significant radiation source is the sun, the shield cone can be significantly truncated with the docking port directed toward the sun
- **Tank rotation**: Slow rotation about the longitudinal axis provides centrifugal acceleration for positive liquid/gas separation (gaseous core at center, liquid against walls)
- **Thermal isolation**: Gas reservoir between equipment deck and tank provides thermal isolation
- **Multi-layer reflective panels**: Mylar, Kapton, or gold-coated materials deployed at angles to form the sunshield cone
- **Deployment mechanism**: Inflatable linear actuators (main booms) extend longitudinally, cross-booms deploy transversely to eliminate gaps. Accordion-folded design enables compact launch configuration
- **22 patent claims** covering the integrated depot-sunshield system, deployment methods, and standalone sunshield technology
- **Patent status**: Abandoned (technology is in public domain)
- **Filing date**: January 23, 2009; **Publication date**: July 29, 2010

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This patent directly addresses the L4/L5 thermal management architecture for the Material Processing Station. The key insight for the Dyson project is that at a Lagrange point, the sunshield cone can be truncated because Earth IR/albedo is negligible -- only solar radiation matters, and it comes from a single predictable direction. The abandoned patent status means the technology is freely available. The deployment mechanism using inflatable booms is relevant for the station's structural design, and the rotation-based propellant settling eliminates the need for complex propellant management devices in microgravity.
