## Abstract

Presents the development and testing of Load Bearing Multilayer Insulation (LBMLI), a structural MLI concept that can support a broad area cooled shield while providing superior thermal performance compared to conventional MLI with separate tank support structures.

## Key Findings

- At cryogenic temperatures (20-90K), LBMLI achieves 51% less heat leakage per layer compared to conventional MLI with tank supports
- LBMLI has 38% less mass compared to conventional MLI systems with separate structural supports
- LBMLI can structurally support a broad area cooled (BAC) shield within the insulation stack, eliminating the need for separate support structures
- The integrated structural capability simplifies the thermal management system architecture
- Performance advantage is most pronounced at the cryogenic temperatures relevant to LH2 storage (20K)
- The technology enables practical implementation of the two-stage thermal management approach (90K BAC shield + 20K tank)

## Relevance to Project Dyson

LBMLI is a key enabling technology for the Material Processing Station's thermal management system. The ability to structurally support a broad area cooled shield within the MLI stack directly enables the two-stage cooling approach described in Plachta (2015): a 90K cryocooler-driven shield intercepting the majority of heat, with a smaller 20K cryocooler handling the residual. The 51% reduction in heat leakage per layer and 38% mass savings compared to conventional MLI both improve the overall system mass budget. For the station design, LBMLI should be the baseline insulation technology rather than conventional MLI.
