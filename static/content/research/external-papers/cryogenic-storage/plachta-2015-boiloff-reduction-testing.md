## Abstract

Documents testing of a cryogenic boiloff reduction system that uses a cryocooler-driven broad area cooling (BAC) shield integrated within multilayer insulation layers to reduce heat leak into a liquid hydrogen tank. The approach places a 90K cooled shield between MLI layers to intercept radiant heat before it reaches the 20K LH2 tank surface.

## Key Findings

- Cryocoolers at LH2 temperatures (20K) are inherently inefficient due to the large temperature difference from ambient, with a maximum Carnot efficiency of just 7%
- The tested approach used a 90K broad area cooling shield within MLI layers to reduce the hot-side temperature seen by the LH2 tank
- By intercepting heat at 90K (where cryocooler efficiency is much higher), the total cooling power required at 20K is dramatically reduced
- The BAC shield approach leverages the much higher efficiency of 90K cryocoolers (Carnot efficiency ~30%) to do the bulk of heat rejection
- This two-stage thermal management approach (90K shield + 20K tank cooling) is more mass-efficient than direct 20K cooling alone

## Relevance to Project Dyson

The two-stage cooling approach tested here is directly applicable to the Material Processing Station's cryogenic storage design. At L4/L5, the passive sunshield reduces the external heat load, but residual heat ingress still requires active management. The 90K BAC shield concept means the station can use relatively mature 90K cryocooler technology for the primary heat intercept, with a much smaller 20K cryocooler handling only the residual load. This staged approach significantly reduces the technology gap identified in the Plachta 2018 paper and makes ZBO more achievable with near-term technology.
