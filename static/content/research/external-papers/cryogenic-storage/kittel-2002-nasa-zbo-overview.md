## Abstract

The foundational overview paper from the tri-center ARC/GRC/MSFC NASA collaboration on zero boil-off cryogenic storage technology. Establishes the baseline framework for understanding cryocooler performance requirements and system-level trade-offs for long-duration cryogenic propellant storage in space.

## Key Findings

- Established the tri-center (Ames Research Center, Glenn Research Center, Marshall Space Flight Center) collaborative framework for ZBO technology development
- Provided early performance estimates for cryocooler requirements across different tank sizes and mission profiles
- Identified key system-level trade-offs between passive insulation mass and active cooling power
- Set the foundation for subsequent NASA ZBO technology development programs
- Outlined the path from laboratory demonstrations to flight-qualified systems

## Relevance to Project Dyson

As the foundational NASA overview paper on ZBO technology, this establishes the baseline technical framework that all subsequent work builds upon. The tri-center collaboration model (ARC for cryocooler analysis, GRC for system integration, MSFC for tank and insulation testing) is relevant as a model for how the Dyson project could structure its own multi-disciplinary research program. The performance estimator methodology developed here provides the analytical basis for sizing cryocoolers against specific tank configurations -- directly applicable to the Material Processing Station's LH2 storage subsystem.
