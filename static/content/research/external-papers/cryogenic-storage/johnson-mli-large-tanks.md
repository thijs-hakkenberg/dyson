## Abstract

Examines multilayer insulation systems for cryogenic propellant storage on large tanks, noting that ground tests of insulation systems on propellant storage size tanks have shown performance and repeatability issues. Presents NASA research on larger tankage applications, addressing boil-off sensitivity, compression effects, assembly joint impacts, and proposes a novel testing approach.

## Key Findings

- MLI contributes between 70% to 90% of the total heat input to cryogenic propellant tanks -- it is the dominant thermal path
- Degradation factors for MLI on large tanks range from 1.6 to 4 compared to ideal small-scale coupon test performance
- Blanket seams and gaps lead to significant heat leaks; heat load increases due to areas of localized compression
- Despite extensive historical data since the 1960s, variability in design and application methods prevents reliable thermal performance predictions at scale
- Dacron netting demonstrates superior thermal performance compared to Nylon as MLI spacer material under cryogenic conditions
- The gap between small-coupon test data and full-scale tank performance is a persistent and unresolved challenge
- Practical MLI installation on large tanks inevitably introduces seams, joints, and compression points that degrade performance

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper is critical for realistic thermal budgeting of the Material Processing Station's cryogenic storage. The 1.6x to 4x degradation factor means that ideal MLI performance numbers from datasheets must be significantly derated for engineering design. For a 100-tonne class LH2 tank, even with state-of-the-art MLI, the actual heat leak will be 2-4x higher than theoretical predictions. This directly impacts the required cryocooler capacity: the active cooling system must be sized for realistic (degraded) MLI performance, not ideal performance. The finding that MLI contributes 70-90% of total heat input also means that MLI quality improvement is the highest-leverage thermal management investment.
