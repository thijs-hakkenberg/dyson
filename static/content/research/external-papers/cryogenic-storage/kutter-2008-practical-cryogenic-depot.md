## Abstract

Presents ULA's concept for a practical cryogenic propellant depot based on Centaur and Delta upper stage flight heritage. The paper describes a depot architecture for Lagrangian points that uses a deployed conical sunshield with slow axial spin for centrifugal liquid settling, achieving near-zero boiloff through passive thermal management rather than active cryocoolers.

## Key Findings

- Depots at Lagrangian points do not encounter significant Earth IR and albedo heating, dramatically simplifying thermal management
- A sunshield similar to the James Webb Space Telescope design can reduce solar heat input by orders of magnitude
- The depot uses a deployed conical sunshield with slow axial spin (rotation about the longitudinal axis)
- Axial spin provides centrifugal acceleration for positive liquid/gas separation (settling propellant against the tank wall)
- The combination of sunshield + MLI + slow spin can achieve near-ZBO passively at Lagrange points
- ULA's extensive Centaur upper stage flight experience with cryogenic propellant management provides high-confidence thermal models
- The architecture is practical and affordable using existing launch vehicle technology

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This is the key sunshield paper for the Material Processing Station design. The architecture described -- conical sunshield + slow axial spin at a Lagrange point -- is exactly the baseline architecture assumed for the L4/L5 cryogenic storage system. The critical insight is that at a Lagrange point, passive thermal management (sunshield + MLI) can do the heavy lifting, reducing or potentially eliminating the need for active cryocoolers. This directly addresses the technology gap identified by Plachta (2018) where flight-rated cryocoolers are orders of magnitude too weak: if passive management reduces the heat load sufficiently, existing cryocooler technology may be adequate for the residual cooling.
