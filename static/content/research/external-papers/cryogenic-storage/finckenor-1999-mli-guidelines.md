## Abstract

The canonical NASA reference document for multilayer insulation material selection, design, and degradation in the space environment. Documents the effects of UV radiation, atomic oxygen erosion, micrometeorite impact, and thermal cycling on MLI performance based on extensive spaceflight data including Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission observations.

## Key Findings

- UV radiation causes embrittlement and discoloration of MLI outer layers, degrading thermal-optical properties over time
- Atomic oxygen (in LEO) erodes exposed polymer surfaces, particularly Kapton, at rates dependent on orbital altitude and solar activity
- Micrometeorite and orbital debris (MMOD) impacts create penetrations that locally degrade MLI performance
- Hubble servicing missions documented MLI degradation severe enough to require astronaut-applied repair patches
- Thermal cycling between sun and shadow causes mechanical fatigue in MLI blankets, leading to delamination and gap formation
- Material selection guidelines: aluminized Kapton preferred for outer layers in LEO, aluminized Mylar acceptable for deep space where atomic oxygen is absent
- MLI degradation is cumulative and accelerates with exposure time
- Design margins must account for end-of-life performance, not beginning-of-life

## Relevance to Project Dyson

As the canonical MLI reference, this document informs the Material Processing Station's insulation design lifetime and maintenance requirements. At L4/L5, the atomic oxygen threat is negligible (unlike LEO), but UV degradation and MMOD impacts remain relevant over the decades-long station lifetime. The key implication is that MLI on the station will require periodic inspection and potentially replacement as a maintenance item. The Hubble experience of needing repair patches after years in space directly informs maintenance planning. Material selection at L4/L5 can use Mylar (lighter, cheaper) rather than Kapton since there is no atomic oxygen exposure.
