## Abstract

Describes the practical layered approach to cryogenic propellant depot thermal management: MLI blanket + deployable sunshield + slow spin rotation. Argues that propellant depots are a critical near-term spacefaring capability that can be implemented with existing technology, and presents a realistic implementation roadmap.

## Key Findings

- Layered thermal management approach: MLI blanket (innermost) + deployable sunshield (outermost) + slow axial spin for propellant settling
- Thermal capacitance of the propellant itself buys months of near-ZBO operation passively, even before active cooling is considered
- Large cryogenic propellant masses have enormous thermal inertia -- a full 100-tonne LH2 tank takes weeks to months to warm appreciably even with imperfect insulation
- The practical depot can be implemented incrementally, starting with existing Centaur/ACES upper stage technology
- Propellant depots are identified as a critical enabling capability for beyond-LEO exploration
- Near-term implementation does not require breakthrough technology -- existing MLI, sunshield, and propellant management techniques are sufficient

## Relevance to Project Dyson

The layered thermal management philosophy described here -- passive first, active only as needed -- is the baseline design philosophy for the Material Processing Station's cryogenic storage. The insight about thermal capacitance is particularly important: even during commissioning before all thermal systems are fully operational, the sheer mass of stored LH2 provides a substantial time buffer. This means the station can accept propellant deliveries and begin operations before the full ZBO cooling system is commissioned, reducing the critical path for station activation.
