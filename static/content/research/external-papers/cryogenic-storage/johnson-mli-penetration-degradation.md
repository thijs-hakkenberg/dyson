## Abstract

Experimental and modeling study of how seams, penetrations, and structural attachments degrade multilayer insulation thermal performance. Quantifies the additional heat leak introduced by practical features that are unavoidable in real tank installations.

## Key Findings

- Penetrations through MLI blankets (for plumbing, instrumentation, structural attachments) create localized thermal short circuits
- The heat leak from penetrations can be a significant fraction of total heat input, even with careful design
- Seams between MLI blankets are another major source of performance degradation beyond ideal predictions
- Combined experimental testing and thermal modeling can predict penetration effects, enabling design optimization
- Penetration heat leak scales with the thermal conductivity and cross-sectional area of the penetrating element
- Low-conductivity materials (composites, fiberglass) for penetrations dramatically reduce heat leak compared to metallic penetrations
- The number and size of penetrations should be minimized in the design phase rather than mitigated after the fact

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Every real cryogenic tank requires penetrations for fill/drain lines, vent lines, instrumentation feedthroughs, and structural attachments. This paper quantifies the thermal penalty of these necessary features and provides design guidelines for minimizing their impact. For the Material Processing Station, the implication is that the cryogenic storage system design must carefully minimize penetrations from the outset and use low-conductivity materials (composite struts, fiberglass feedthroughs) wherever penetrations are unavoidable. The thermal budget must account for penetration heat leaks in addition to the MLI degradation factors from the Johnson large tanks paper.
