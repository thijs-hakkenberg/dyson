## Abstract

The most recent comprehensive review of cryogenic propellant management in space, covering reference missions, depot architectures, technology demonstrators, and identifying remaining gaps in physical knowledge. Published in npj Microgravity (Nature) as an open-access article.

## Key Findings

- Comprehensive survey of reference missions requiring cryogenic propellant storage (lunar, Mars, deep space)
- Reviews all major depot architecture concepts including LEO, cislunar Lagrange points, and lunar surface
- Catalogues technology demonstrators flown and planned, assessing technology readiness levels
- Identifies that many gaps in physical knowledge still need to be filled, particularly regarding fluid behavior in reduced gravity
- Sloshing, phase separation, and heat transfer in microgravity remain poorly understood at operationally relevant scales
- The reference list is extensive, citing essentially every significant AIAA paper, NASA Technical Memorandum, and Cryogenics journal article in this domain
- Reviews passive (MLI, sunshields, vapor cooling) and active (cryocoolers) thermal management approaches
- Notes that no long-duration cryogenic storage has been demonstrated in space -- all current data is from short-duration upper stage coasts or ground tests

## Relevance to Project Dyson

As the most current comprehensive review (2024), this paper provides the definitive snapshot of where the field stands. Its identification of remaining knowledge gaps -- particularly fluid behavior in microgravity at scale -- directly informs the Phase 0 research questions. The extensive reference list is invaluable as a literature survey starting point. The key gap identified (no long-duration space demonstration) underscores the importance of ground testing and modeling before committing to a station design. For Project Dyson, this paper validates the research approach: the technology building blocks exist but have never been integrated and demonstrated at scale in space.
