## Abstract

Comprehensive review of NASA's ZBO concept development history, the trade space for distributed cooling architectures, and progress on reverse turbo-Brayton cycle cryocoolers for long-duration cryogenic propellant storage in space. Presents the current state of cryocooler technology and the development path needed to achieve zero boil-off for large-scale LH2 storage.

## Key Findings

- The largest flight cryocoolers available have less than 1W of cooling capacity at 20K and approximately 20W at 90K
- Current cryocooler capacity is over an order of magnitude short of what LH2 zero boil-off requires for large tanks
- NASA invested in development of a 20K/20W reverse Brayton cryocooler with Creare Inc. as a stepping stone toward ZBO capability
- Reverse turbo-Brayton cycle identified as the most promising cryocooler architecture for space ZBO applications
- Distributed cooling approaches (broad area cooling) are critical for managing thermal gradients across large tank surfaces
- The paper presents the full history of ZBO concept development across NASA centers

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This is arguably the single most important reference paper for the cryogenic storage subsystem of the Material Processing Station at L4/L5. The fundamental constraint it identifies -- that current cryocooler capacity is orders of magnitude below what is needed for 100-tonne class LH2 tanks -- directly shapes the Phase 0 research roadmap. The development path from current ~1W@20K to the required ~100W+ at 20K represents a critical technology gap that must be closed or worked around through passive thermal management (sunshields, MLI) to reduce the active cooling burden. The reverse turbo-Brayton architecture discussed here is the leading candidate for the active cooling system.
