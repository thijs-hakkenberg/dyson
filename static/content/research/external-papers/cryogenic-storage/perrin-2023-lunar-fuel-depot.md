## Abstract

Analyzes fuel depot architectures for lunar mission support, with specific focus on Earth-Moon L1 as the optimal depot location. Establishes cryocooler performance requirements needed to maintain zero boil-off for LH2 and LOX at the depot, providing a modern update to earlier depot concepts.

## Key Findings

- Specifically recommends Earth-Moon L1 as the optimal location for a cryogenic propellant depot supporting lunar missions
- Establishes quantitative cryocooler performance requirements (cooling power at temperature) needed to achieve ZBO at L1
- Builds on the Kutter/ULA depot concepts with updated thermal analysis and mission requirements
- Addresses both LH2 and LOX storage requirements, noting the significantly different thermal challenges
- Modern analysis incorporating current cryocooler technology readiness levels
- Provides mission-specific propellant demand rates that drive depot sizing

## Relevance to Project Dyson

While this paper focuses on Earth-Moon L1 rather than Earth-Sun L4/L5, the methodology for establishing cryocooler performance requirements is directly transferable. The L1 thermal environment is actually more challenging than L4/L5 (due to proximity to Earth IR/albedo), so the performance requirements established here represent an upper bound for what would be needed at the Material Processing Station. The depot sizing methodology and propellant demand analysis also inform the station's logistics planning for receiving and storing cryogenic propellants.
