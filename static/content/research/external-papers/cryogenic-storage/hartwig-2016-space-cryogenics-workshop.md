## Abstract

Summary of NASA's Space Cryogenics Workshop results, presenting validated test data showing that adding a cryocooler to achieve zero boil-off is the lower-mass option compared to carrying extra boiloff propellant when storage times exceed a few weeks. Documents broad area cooling test results with temperature gradients under 4K across the cooled shield.

## Key Findings

- Testing validated that ZBO via cryocooler is the lower-mass option when storage times exceed approximately 2-4 weeks
- For short missions (days), carrying extra propellant to account for boiloff is lighter than the cryocooler system mass
- For long-duration storage (weeks to months+), the cryocooler mass is more than offset by propellant mass savings
- Broad area cooling achieved temperature gradients under 4K across the cooled shield surface, demonstrating uniformity
- The crossover point (where ZBO becomes mass-advantageous) depends on tank size, insulation quality, and thermal environment
- Workshop consensus supported the broad area cooling + LBMLI approach as the preferred architecture
- Results directly support the case for active ZBO on any long-duration space mission or permanent depot

## Relevance to Project Dyson

This paper provides the definitive mass trade-off justification for active ZBO at the Material Processing Station. Since the station is a permanent installation with storage times measured in months to years (not days), the cryocooler approach is unambiguously the lower-mass option. The validated BAC temperature uniformity (less than 4K gradient) confirms that the broad area cooling concept works as designed and can be confidently incorporated into the station's thermal management baseline. Combined with LBMLI (Johnson 2014) to structurally support the BAC shield, this defines the complete insulation/cooling architecture: sunshield (passive) + LBMLI with integrated BAC shield (90K cryocooler) + direct tank cooling (20K cryocooler).
