## Abstract

Documents the Kennedy Space Center Ground Operations Demonstration Unit for Liquid Hydrogen (GODU-LH2) project, a ground-based demonstration of zero boil-off technology at operationally relevant scale. A 125,000-liter LH2 tank was integrated with a Linde LR1620 refrigerator providing 390W of cooling at 20K, and ZBO was achieved using three different control methods.

## Key Findings

- A 125,000-liter (approximately 8,800 kg) LH2 tank achieved zero boil-off using a commercial Linde LR1620 refrigerator
- The refrigerator provided 390W of cooling capacity at 20K -- far exceeding current spaceflight cryocooler capability
- Three different ZBO control methods were demonstrated: direct tank cooling, subcooling, and destratification
- The demonstration validated that ZBO is achievable at operationally relevant scales given sufficient cooling power
- Ground-based refrigeration systems can provide the required cooling, but mass and power constraints of space systems require fundamentally different approaches
- The 390W at 20K cooling requirement sets a benchmark for what space-rated systems must eventually achieve

## Relevance to Project Dyson

GODU-LH2 is the most directly relevant ground truth data point for scaling ZBO to the Material Processing Station. The 125,000-liter tank (roughly 1/8th the volume of a 100-tonne LH2 storage system) demonstrated that ZBO works at scale -- the challenge is entirely in the cooling system's mass, power, and reliability for spaceflight. The 390W@20K cooling requirement, when scaled to a larger tank with better insulation and a sunshield at L4/L5, provides a concrete target for the active cooling subsystem. The three control methods validated here inform operational procedures for propellant management at the station.
