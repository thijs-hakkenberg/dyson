## Abstract

Comprehensive comparison of xenon, krypton, and argon for Hall thruster applications. SpaceX Starlink V2 Mini satellites operationally deploy argon-fueled Hall thrusters with 2.4x thrust and 1.5x Isp over previous krypton thrusters. Argon costs $7-15/kg vs xenon at $5,000-12,000/kg.

## Key Findings

- SpaceX operational argon thrusters at scale (Starlink V2 Mini)
- 2.4x thrust improvement over previous krypton thrusters
- Argon $7-15/kg vs xenon $5K-12K/kg
- Essentially unlimited supply of argon
- Krypton as intermediate option

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Directly resolves the core of rq-1-31 -- argon viability proven at constellation scale by SpaceX. The combination of dramatically lower cost, effectively unlimited supply, and demonstrated operational performance makes argon the clear baseline propellant choice for Project Dyson's electric propulsion systems.
