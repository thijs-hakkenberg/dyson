## Abstract

Comprehensive review of alternative propellants for Hall thrusters covering krypton, argon, iodine, bismuth, and other candidates.

## Key Findings

- Comprehensive technology assessment across propellant candidates
- Argon Isp up to 1,500s with extended channels
- Purpose-built designs outperform adapted xenon designs

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Provides comprehensive landscape for rq-1-31 propellant selection. The finding that purpose-built thruster designs outperform adapted xenon designs is important -- Project Dyson should specify argon-optimized thrusters rather than adapting existing xenon hardware.
