## Abstract

Performance characterization of ST-40M Hall thruster on xenon and krypton propellants from IEPC 2025 conference.

## Key Findings

- Krypton achieves equivalent thrust to xenon but with ~30% performance reduction
- Detailed parametric data across operating conditions

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Provides engineering data for krypton-primary thruster option in rq-1-31. While argon is the baseline choice, krypton offers a middle-ground option with better performance than argon and dramatically lower cost than xenon.
