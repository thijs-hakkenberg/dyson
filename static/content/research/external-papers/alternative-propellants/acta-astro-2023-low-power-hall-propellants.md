## Abstract

Comparative testing of multiple gaseous propellants in low-power Hall thruster. Iodine shown to offer similar performance to xenon. Argon-xenon mixtures show promise.

## Key Findings

- Iodine matches xenon at all power levels
- Argon-xenon mixtures facilitate ionization
- Multi-propellant data at 100W class

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Identifies iodine as third option for rq-1-31 with near-xenon performance. Iodine is storable as a solid and sublimated on demand, offering interesting logistics advantages for deep space operations.
