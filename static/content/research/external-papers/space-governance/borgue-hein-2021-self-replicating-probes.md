## Abstract

Concept design for near-term self-replicating probe. Estimates ~70% self-replication rate achievable with current/near-term technologies for sub-100 kg probe, limited by AI, AM, and resource harvesting TRL.

## Key Findings

- ~70% self-replication rate achievable near-term
- Sub-100 kg probe class
- AI, AM, and resource harvesting are limiting factors
- Directly relevant to mass closure ratio

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Provides quantitative self-replication estimates directly relevant to rq-0-29 and Project Dyson mass closure ratio targets. The ~70% figure establishes a realistic upper bound for near-term self-replication capability, informing the balance between ISRU-produced and Earth-supplied components.
