## Abstract

Analysis of governance gaps for autonomous self-replicating systems in space. Artemis Accords legitimize resource extraction but are silent on self-replication. Proposes weaponisation ban, replication cycle limits, target selection protocols, and mission termination mechanisms.

## Key Findings

- Artemis Accords silent on self-replication
- Proposed treaty elements include weaponisation ban, replication limits, target protocols, termination mechanisms

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Directly relevant to rq-0-29 governance of self-replicating manufacturing systems. Project Dyson's approach to autonomous replication must proactively address these governance gaps, particularly around replication cycle limits and termination mechanisms.
