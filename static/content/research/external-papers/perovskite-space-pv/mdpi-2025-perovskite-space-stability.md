## Abstract

Reviews development of radiation-tolerant perovskite solar cells for space. Notes that lattice fluidity enabling self-healing can also cause ionic flow and decomposition under prolonged radiation. Proper testing requires stable high-efficiency devices and 50-150 keV protons.

## Key Findings

- Perovskites do exhibit genuine self-healing under radiation damage
- Lattice fluidity is double-edged: enables self-healing but also causes ionic flow and decomposition
- Early low-efficiency test cells may have masked damage
- Proper testing protocol defined: requires stable high-efficiency devices and 50-150 keV protons

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Provides critical nuance to rq-1-9 self-healing narrative -- cautions against over-optimism while confirming mechanism exists. Project Dyson should plan for partial rather than complete self-healing, with replacement schedules based on realistic degradation curves from properly tested high-efficiency cells.
