## Abstract

Systematic comparison of four polymer encapsulants for flexible perovskite cells under LEO proton radiation. Polyimide (PI) emerged as best encapsulation at all proton energy levels.

## Key Findings

- Polyimide is best encapsulation material for perovskite under proton radiation
- Outperforms alternatives at all energy levels
- Aligns with Kapton as Project Dyson baseline substrate

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Validates polyimide (Kapton) substrate choice for rq-1-9, confirming dual-purpose as both substrate and radiation protection. This is a significant finding because it means the structural substrate itself provides meaningful radiation shielding, reducing the need for additional protection layers.
