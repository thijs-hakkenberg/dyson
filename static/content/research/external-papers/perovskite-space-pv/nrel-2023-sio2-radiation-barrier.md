## Abstract

NREL demonstrates micron-thick SiO2 layer as radiation barrier for perovskite cells. Reduces weight of conventional radiation barriers by >99%. Protected cells show no damage from low-energy proton bombardment. Extended projected lifetime from months to years.

## Key Findings

- Micron-thick SiO2 layer is highly effective radiation barrier
- >99% weight reduction vs conventional radiation barriers
- No damage from low-energy protons with SiO2 protection
- 19% efficiency retained under moisture/temp stress (vs 10.8% unprotected)

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Directly addresses rq-1-9 radiation protection challenge. SiO2 + polyimide substrate emerging as baseline architecture for the thin-film solar collector arrays. The dramatic weight reduction compared to conventional glass cover sheets is critical for achieving the mass targets required for economical launch to L4/L5.
