## Abstract

Georgia Tech sending 18 photovoltaic cells including perovskite to ISS exterior via MISSE-21 mission for 6 months of in-situ testing of thermal cycling, radiation degradation, and atomic oxygen exposure.

## Key Findings

- 18 PV cells (including perovskite) going to ISS exterior
- 6-month exposure test covering thermal cycling, radiation, and atomic oxygen
- Multiple chemistries compared under identical conditions
- Data expected mid-2026

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Will provide the first in-situ LEO data for perovskite PV directly relevant to rq-1-9 space qualification decisions. While LEO conditions differ from L4/L5 (different radiation spectrum, thermal cycling), this real-world data will be invaluable for validating or correcting ground-based test predictions.
