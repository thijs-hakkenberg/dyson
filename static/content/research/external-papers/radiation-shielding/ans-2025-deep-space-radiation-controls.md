## Abstract

Proposes using lunar regolith launched via mass driver to line spacecraft hulls. Discusses radiation protection approaches for deep space missions.

## Key Findings

- Lunar regolith as shielding material via mass driver
- Relevant to mass driver infrastructure for material transport

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Direct cross-reference to Project Dyson mass driver infrastructure for rq-0-35. If mass driver capacity exists for material transport, using a fraction of that capacity to deliver regolith shielding material could provide low-cost radiation protection for habitat modules.
