## Abstract

AstroRad radiation protection vest has flown to ISS and around Moon on Artemis I. Uses high-density polyethylene (HDPE) conforming to body anatomy with variable thickness based on organ sensitivity.

## Key Findings

- Flight-proven HDPE selective shielding
- Flown on ISS and Artemis I
- Variable thickness by organ sensitivity
- Could reduce habitat shielding mass requirements

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Demonstrates selective shielding approach for rq-0-35 that could reduce per-module shielding mass. Rather than uniformly shielding entire habitat volumes, selective shielding of crew sleeping quarters and workstations combined with storm shelters for SPE events could significantly reduce total shielding mass.
