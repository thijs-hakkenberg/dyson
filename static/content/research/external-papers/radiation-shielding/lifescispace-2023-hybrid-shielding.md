## Abstract

Novel study of combining electrostatic active shielding with passive materials. For SPEs, active outside passive is optimal. For GCRs, passive before active allows intentional HZE ion fragmentation. Hybrid could reduce shielding mass by 20-40% vs passive-only.

## Key Findings

- Hybrid active-passive shielding reduces mass 20-40%
- Optimal configuration depends on radiation type
- SPEs: active outside passive is optimal
- GCRs: passive before active allows intentional HZE ion fragmentation

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Key finding for rq-0-35 -- hybrid approach could bring shielding estimate from 4-8K kg to 3-5K kg per module. The configuration-dependent optimization (different arrangements for SPE vs GCR) suggests a reconfigurable or dual-layer approach may be warranted for the habitat modules.
