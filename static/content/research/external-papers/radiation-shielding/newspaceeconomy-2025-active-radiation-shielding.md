## Abstract

MgB2 high-temperature superconductors from CERN LHC program enable magnetic shielding with passive cooling using deep-space cold + sunshields. Eliminates active cryocoolers. Active shielding TRL remains low for near-term use.

## Key Findings

- MgB2 HTS enables passive-cooled magnetic shielding
- CERN LHC technology transfer opportunity
- Eliminates cryocooler requirement using deep-space cold + sunshields
- TRL still low for near-term deployment

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Long-term option for rq-0-35 active shielding without cryocooler power penalty. The passive cooling approach using deep-space thermal environment and sunshields aligns well with the existing sunshield infrastructure planned for cryogenic storage, suggesting potential dual-use of thermal management systems.
