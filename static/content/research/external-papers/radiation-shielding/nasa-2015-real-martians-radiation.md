## Abstract

NASA analysis confirming strategic placement of water as shielding provides best mass-efficiency trade for deep-space radiation protection.

## Key Findings

- Water placement as dual-use shielding is most mass-efficient
- Confirms HDPE/polyethylene as effective low-Z material
- Strategic placement around crew quarters maximizes protection per unit mass

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Supports dual-use water shielding strategy for rq-0-35 using ISRU-produced water. Water storage tanks positioned around crew sleeping quarters and work areas serve double duty as consumable storage and radiation protection, improving the mass budget for habitat modules.
