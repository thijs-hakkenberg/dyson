## Abstract

Comprehensive evaluation of radiation and microgravity risks for deep space exploration. Reviews shielding approaches, biological countermeasures, and mission design strategies.

## Key Findings

- Comprehensive risk evaluation framework
- Biological countermeasures complement physical shielding
- Mission design can reduce cumulative exposure

## Relevance to Project Dyson

Provides broader context for rq-0-35 beyond pure shielding mass considerations. Highlights that radiation protection is a multi-layered problem requiring physical shielding, operational procedures, and biological countermeasures working together.
